# grim-hollow-parsing
This repo is a collection of jupyter scripts used to break down tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) PDFs 
into text and images that are cleaner/easier to integrate into a virtual table top (VTT) such as Foundry VTT.
It is specifically being used on the Grim Hollow 5th edition Dungeons and Dragons supplements.

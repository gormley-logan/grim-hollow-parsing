Dragonborn Vampire
“The vampire had golden scales and glittering eyes. It breathed 
fire, charring and rotting flesh at the same time.”
Precise Predator.
 Dragonborn subjected to vampirism 
become calculating killers. They enjoy the hunt and the 
fight, but they approach each with cunning and skill. 
Even dragonborn vampire spawn are calmer and more 
precise than is normal for vampires of that age. This love 
of the hunt and battle, nevertheless, makes dragonborn 
vampires more likely to take risks, which their pack mates 
take advantage of. Many dragonborn vampires perish in 
confrontations before aging into more power. 
Rotting Breath.
 Vampirism pollutes the draconic bloodline 
with a curse of undeath. This corruption strengthens 
the dragonborn’s breath weapon, allowing it to deal the 
damage it dealt before alongside life-withering necrosis. 
A dragonborn vampire can also use this breath more 
often than living counterparts
.
salvage
A dragonborn vampire’s teeth hold magic more readily 
than other vampires. Someone who has proficiency with 
smith’s tools can fashion a vampire’s fang into a 
corrupted-
tusk-dagger
 (see chapter 4). Making the weapon requires 
5 days of work and other materials worth 250 gp. To 
utilize the teeth properly, the smith or somebody assisting 
them must have proficiency in the Arcana, Nature, or 
Religion skill.

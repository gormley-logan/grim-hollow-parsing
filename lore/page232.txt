N
Nacambra
“The foul odor of a nacambra should be warning of its 
presence, yet it manages to creep unnoticed through the 
shadows, preying on those who can’t easily defend themselves.
Shadow Suckers
. Nacambras come out at night. They 
“bite” a victim’s shadow, pinning the unfortunate in 
place and magically sucking blood through the shadow.
Hideous Hybrid
. A nacambra resembles a hornless 
goat, but has large ears and a long, flexible tail that can 
be used as a whip. It’s often seen walking backwards 
with its head lowered between its hind legs.
Horrible Odor
. A nacambra exudes a stench of decay 
that can overwhelm the senses of nearby creatures, 
causing them to become nauseated. The stench serves 
as a defense mechanism.
Picky Eaters
. Although the nacambra usually stalks 
easy prey, sometimes it emerges from its lair in search 
of children, who it kills to harvest their hearts, which its 
master uses to fashion amulets.
Magical Minions
. Those who possess the power to 
command nacambras are sorcerers called nacambraan, 
said to keep nacambras in jars made of clay.

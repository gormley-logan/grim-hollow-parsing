Wandering Head
“Ugly brutes, aye, but one offered me a magic necklace to take 
care of a merchant what stiffed him on a deal, so they can’t be all 
bad. Strangest thing though, I can’t seem to take it off…”
All Head.
 Wandering heads are grotesque beings that 
roam the wilderness in search of travelers to torment. The 
creature is a horse-sized head balanced on two spindly 
legs with arms that protrude from gaps in its teeth. 
Wandering heads carry sacks filled with objects they use 
in deceitful bargaining, always trying to twist the deal.
Crafty Bargainers.
 A wandering head’s first instinct 
is to bargain. They approach and use divination magic 
to offer others what they need most. In exchange, the 
head asks for treasure or a favor. Cunning as they are, 
wandering heads attempt to trick others into committing 
an evil act or losing badly on the deal in some other way.
Corrupted Giants.
 Enuil Stonetongue, a follower of 
Malikir, once sought to turn hill giants to his master’s 
service. The giants proved too dim to adequately follow 
orders, so Enuil vowed that if they could not make good 
use of their heads he would. His curse warped and 
twisted those giants into the first wandering heads. Enuil 
taught these heads wizardry.
salvage
A wandering head carries tools and trinkets to tempt 
travelers into making deals. At least one magic item can 
be found in the head’s sack, although such items are 
often cursed.

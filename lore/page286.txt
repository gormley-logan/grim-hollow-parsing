Resurrection Horror
“Sometimes it’s better to stay dead. Something 
always tries to balance the scales.”
Price to Be Paid
. A resurrection horror is spawned 
the midnight after a creature who died on unhallowed 
ground is returned to life. The horror seeks to return 
the resurrected creature to death.
Swath of Destruction
. Resurrection horrors unerringly 
move toward the resurrected creature, no matter how far 
away they may be, killing anything that tries to interfere.
Spawned of the Grave
. Resurrection horrors are 
massive undead built of the bones of many bodies and 
the unhallowed dirt the returned creature died upon.
salvage
The grave dirt of a resurrection horror can be refined to 
create a pouch of dirt that when sprinkled as an action 
works as a 
scroll of protection from necrotic energy 
and 
protection from good and evil
 with a 30-minute duration. 
The process requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check by someone proficient in the Religion 
skill who works for 8 hours and uses 300 gp worth of 
additional components.

Trennensel
“The cattle lows mournfully as the twisted shape, batlike and 
somehow childlike, drinks deeply of the bovine’s blood. The farmer 
blanches before dropping his pitchfork and fleeing in terror.”
Flying Blood Drinkers.
 Trennensels are batlike and 
hairless. They come in a variety of skin colors, and they 
can be mistaken for flying humanoids. They drink blood. 
Due to their lack of hair, they need to consume more to 
maintain body heat.
A trennensel prefers to feed on livestock, making the 
creatures pests to ranchers. They roost in caves by day 
and hunt at dusk. Trennensels spread out from their 
lair to feed, but careless spelunkers could rouse a whole 
colony of these creatures.

worth 25 gp to make one dose of 
oil of slipperiness
. 
Acquiring enough guano to refine, a few pounds, likely 
involves venturing into a trennensel colony cave. Making 
the oil requires 4 hours of work and a successful DC 13 
Intelligence or Wisdom (Arcana) check.

Lithobel
“The two-headed, four-armed, blood-covered statue 
moves forward, weapons at the ready.”
Duels in Tormach’s Honor.
 With the rise of the Cult 
of Tormach throughout Unterland, the bloody ambitions 
of Speaker Schlei have come to fruition more and more. 
Under his orders, cultists devoted to the demented Arch 
Daemon of war fight one another to the death in single 
combat as an offering of sacrificial bloodshed. If both 
combatants die from their wounds and their combat is 
glorious, Tormach grants the devotees special favor.
Commemorated for Eternity.
 Tormach grafts 
combatants honored for their bloodthirsty sacrifice, 
together forming a four-armed, two-headed creature 
known as a lithobel. The creature’s skin is transmuted 
into rough stone, and it is granted massive stone weapons 
capable of slaughtering a draft horse in a single swing. 
The hulking creature is then turned loose on the hapless 
population of Etharis, possessing only the drive to maim 
and kill any living creature unlucky enough to cross its path.
salvage
The powdered stone of a lithobel’s heads can be used in 
place of diamond dust for the 
stoneskin
 spell. One lithobel 
produces powder worth 1,000 gp.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 This foul creature is 
the result of a battle to the death between two followers 
of Tormach. It wants only blood. Poison is ineffective, 
and nonmagical attacks do the creature less harm.

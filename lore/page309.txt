Skywailer
“These things float silently at night. If you hear their 
wail, it means someone you know is being eaten.”
Floating Horrors.
 Skywailers are aberrations like giant, 
airborne jelly fish, sporting long tentacles. Covered in 
bloated air sacs and humanoid faces, they emit a horrific 
wailing noise when they manage to entrap prey. A sky-
wailer usually drifts aimlessly, looking for food. If 
it spots a likely morsel, it can jet forward rapidly.
Psionic Manifestations.
 Skywailers can also spit 
psychically toxic ectoplasm. Useful at longer range than 
the skywailer’s tentacles, the ectoplasm tendrils still 
allow the skywailer to reel prey in. Once the monster 
has one or more victims in its grasp, it emits a psionic 
keening that can kill.
salvage
An airtight bladder can be used to collect the gas trapped 
within a skywailer’s sacs, provided the creature capturing 
the gas succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check. One dose of this gas can be consumed, acting as a 
potion of flying
 that lasts for 1 minute. One skywailer has 
enough gas for someone to collect 2d6 doses.

DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Certain individuals 
have split identities—one of civil refinement and another 
of unbridled rage. These people are called the fractured.
DC 13 Intelligence (History):
 Fractured can hide in 
plain sight. Outwardly polite and upstanding members 
of society, wicked fractured indulge their violent 
impulses whenever they feel they can escape detection. 
Those with more scruples might still use their rage to 
commit crimes.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 When unleashing their 
rage, the fractured’s appearance alters to the point that 
features are unrecognizable. Crimes committed in this 
form are hard to link to the fractured’s public persona.
GM Advice:
 In general, fractured are in control of their transfor-
mations, even if they are not totally rational when transformed. They 
revel in their dual-natured destruction, electrified by the violence 
while enraged, then thrilled by the secret that they must cover up.
Adventures can be created where the fractured are not in control—
or even aware—of their transformations. This could be caused 
by some outside force. Tracking down first who the fractured 
are, and then who is causing their troubles, is a strong plot of an 
investigative adventure

Weird Horrors.
 Horror flits are nightmarish creatures 
that defy imagination. They start as small, sickly green-

pseudopods, which grasp ground, root, limb, and trunk, 
then fling the creature in the desired direction. Upon 
reaching prey, a flit’s conical mouth, lined with rows of 
teeth, opens. Then the real terror begins.

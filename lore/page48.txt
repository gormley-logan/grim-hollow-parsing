Cadeer
“Folks say they were once humans. An old forest goddess 
cursed them for being too greedy for magic. Not sure I believe 
that, but it explains that glint in their eyes.”
Magic Seekers.
 Cadeers look like deer, but they have 
the tail of a snake and black, featureless eyes. They’re 
not only sapient, but highly intelligent. Cadeers can also 
sense and track magic over long distances, and they seek 
it out with zeal.
Untrustworthy Partners.
 A cadeer might partner with 
other beings to seek and find magic. But they can’t be trusted 
to share anything that’s found. Cadeers prioritize their 
desires and goals. And they might even switch sides in a 
battle if doing so means acquiring the magic they’re after.
Antler Absorption.
 Cadeer antlers can’t be harmed 
by magic, but they can store it. A cadeer can use a spell 
stored in this way. To keep a spell, a cadeer can also 
prevent the antlers from absorbing more magic.
salvage
Cadeer antlers are valuable, fetching at least 75 gp each. 
A cadeer antler can be fashioned into a wand suitable as 
a spellcasting focus for arcane spellcasters and druids. 
If made into a magic item, this wand has 1 extra charge 
per day. Also, once per day and at the cost of 1 charge 
thereafter, a magic wand of cadeer horn grants the 
wielder a d4 that can be rolled when the wielder makes 
a spellcasting ability check to see if 
dispel magic
 or 
counterspell
 works. The wielder adds the number rolled 
on the d4 to the spellcasting ability check.

Grief Eater
“Cities are meant to be hubs of prosperity and culture. But all 
I see are the sad, poverty-stricken slums. Little did we know, 
when you spend enough time in those places you’ll learn of 
creatures with a taste for broken hearts.”
Despair Devourers.
 Grief eaters are fey predators 
attracted to the essence of concentrated despair. They hide 
in a city’s alleys and crumbling buildings, seeking hopeless 
people to feed on. These victims usually perish, causing a 
string of disappearances that can cause a serial-killer rumor 
to flare up, along with a rising population of grief eaters.
Downcast Decoy.
 A grief eater appears to be a cloaked 
person, down on their luck. These “people” hunch over, 
crying and babbling. Observant viewers notice the cloak 
is really a grey membrane. Legs “clutched” to the chest 
are part of a warped torso. The creature travels on its 
long, spindly arms.

A grief eater’s “hood” is a sensitive membrane that 
allows the creature to detect despair and other grief 
eaters. Someone who has proficiency in the Arcana and 
Medicine skills can remove this membrane intact with a 
successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Somebody 
who has proficiency with leatherworker’s or weaver’s 
tools can use six of these membranes to create a 
morose 
monocle
 (see chapter 4). Creating this monocle takes  
5 days and other materials worth 100 gp.

“If you find a statue in the wild with its mouth open in a 
scream, flee. Best case, it’s an artist working out their twisted 
ideas. Worst case, you’ll be a statue soon.”
Petrifying Predators.
 The fiendish lupilisks can be 
found in woodland areas or amid an infernal army.  
their impressive strength and agility, as well as their size, 
makes them perfect mounts for infernal cavalry. And 
their keen instincts mark them as an apex predator.

Coral Grazer
“I used to live in a village in the western shallows. Then a 
grazer came by and, in one night, everything I knew was gone.”
Unnatural Disasters.
 Sea- and coast-dwellers fear 
coral grazers. Many such people consider the arrival of a 
coral grazer to be a natural disaster, but these monsters 
are far from natural. Equipped with beaked tentacles 
surrounding its single massive eye, a coral grazer uses its 
beaks to tear apart and consume coral. But the creature 
doesn’t restrict itself to coral shelfs—it eats anything made 
of a similar substance, from shells to some stone. It also 
consumes bones, although in smaller quantities. One coral 
grazer can lay waste to a whole fishing village.
Ancient Horrors.
 Accounts of coral grazers can be found 
throughout recorded history, yet their origins remain 
a mystery. The oldest legends tell of a cataclysm that 
precedes the creatures being seen in the shallows. Sages 
speculate this disaster either gave rise to coral grazers or 
forced them into new territory. The look of coral grazers 
is akin that of Aether Kindred and denizens of their mad 
realm. If the cataclysm that gave rise to coral grazers had 
its source there, it could explain much.
Progeny Plague.
 Coral grazer spawn can be as much 
of a threat as their elder kin. Larvae are up to 6 feet long 
and they eat tremendous amounts to fuel their growth. 
After gorging themselves for a year, they retreat to deeper 
waters, returning to familiar feeding territory when they 
have reached full size. Most folk prefer to kill the larvae 
before they can grow.

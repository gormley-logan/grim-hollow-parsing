Styrkvisnar
“The appearance of the tripart styrkvisnar terrifies 
anyone viewing it, but it’s presence hints at a 
master even more terrifying.”
Monstrous Servant.
 When a powerful being of great 
evil, such as a memori lich, is created, residual power 
courses out into the world, changing and attracting nearby 
creatures. One such result is a styrkvisnar, a monster 
appearing to be part wolf, part eagle, and part seal.
Corrupt Connection.
 Styrkvisnars bond with potent 
evil beings, becoming servants and scouts. Such a bond 
takes 24 hours to establish. Once the bond forms, the 
styrkvisnar makes every effort to carry out the wishes 
of its new master. It uses its shapechanger ability to 
accomplish tasks for which a monstrous form won’t do.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with leatherworker’s 
tools can fashion the hide of a styrkvisnar into a 
cloak 
of therianthropy
 (see chapter 4). Doing so takes 10 days, 
other materials worth 2,000 gp, and a successful DC 15 
Intelligence or Wisdom check.
lore

 A styrkvisnar is 
a monstrous blend of a wolf, eagle, and seal. It can 
shapechange into a humanoid.

 Styrkvisnars are created 
by or attracted to the welling of power at points where 
mighty and wicked creatures permanently transform 
into a monstrous being, such as a lich. The styrkvisnar 
serves the reborn being.

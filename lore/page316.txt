Soman Vampire
“The rest of the world calls vampires monsters. 
In Soma, we call them ‘your highness.’”
The Crimson Court.
 Vampires rule as part of the 
Crimson Court of Soma. These vampires openly declare 
their presence, presiding over a land shrouded in eternal 
night. The Crimson Court is a place of subtle political 
maneuvering interspersed with hedonistic indulgence, 
all at the expense of the serfs, who serve at their undead 
masters’ whim.
Aristocratic Predators.
 Soman vampires worm 
their way into high society, seeking positions of power 
and authority, presupposing the vampire lacks those. 
In gaining immortality while retaining their appearance 
and sapience, vampires consider themselves superior 
to other undead and to mere mortals. To them, ruling is 
their right, and normal folk are little more than cattle.
Unique to Soma.
 Soman vampires are different from 
other vampires, which are detailed in chapter 2. Their 
special strain of vampirism gives them unique powers. 
They are careful to pass on their “gift” with their blood 
only to the worthy.
salvage
Soman vampires crumble into dust when they die, 
and alchemists value that dust for its properties. The 
Morbus Doctore purchase vampire dust. Sold to such a 
buyer, one vampire yields dust worth 100 gp times its 
Challenge. The dust must be kept dry and out of direct 
sunlight to retain its value and usefulness.
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s 
supplies can use the dust and other materials worth 
500 gp to make an 
elixir of life protection
 (see chapter 4). 
Making the elixir takes 2 days and requires the alchemist 
to succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom check.

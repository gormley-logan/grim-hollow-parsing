The exploded metal hide of the Empyrean brazen bull 
can be harvested to make gleaming and radiant 
brazen 
armor
 (see Chapter 4). A proficient armor smith can make 
a suit of 
brazen armor
 by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength 
(Athletics) check and using 2500 gp of components. This 
process takes 20 days to complete. 
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature)
: Wildfires that seem to 
begin with hoofprints are sometimes found during the dry 
season in farmland, and bright spots on the horizon that 
look like a massive cow are often reported at the same time.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion)
: The Empyrean 
brazen bull is a beast of burden for angels, used for 
besieging enemies.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
: The Empyrean brazen 
bull explodes when it dies, and luck be with all in the 
wake of the blast.
GM Advice:
 The Empyrean brazen bull is obviously a strong 
force on the side of law and good, and evil or chaotic characters 
could easily find themselves getting the horns if they mess with 
the bull. However, just like any other creatures, brazen bulls 
can be tricked into working against their own interests. They 
can also be manipulated or corrupted by agents of evil to 
work against good characters.
Brazen bulls can be altered to take other forms as well. 
Other forms might have different modes of movement to 
match their environment, and they might have different 
types of natural weapons. Regardless of the form they 
take, however, their attacks and traits should remain the 
same. An Empyreus brazen dragon or whale, for example, 
might be able to fly or swim, but theyâ€™ll still be able to 
charge, swallow, damage with their aura, and explode 
when defeated.

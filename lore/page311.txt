Slimm
“The ooze dripping from the tall person in the 
grey clothing indicates something is amiss.”
Rare Ooze.
 A new strain of ooze dubbed the slimm has 
been seen in the ruins of Etharis, particularly in areas 
struck by the Weeping Pox. This fluid creature takes 
a form reminiscent of a tall, lanky person. Its coloring 
makes it resemble a man wearing a black coat over a 
gray suit. The protoplasm forming “exposed skin” is a 
waxy yellow-gray color.
Defensive Actor.
 No one can mistake a slimm for a 
humanoid for long, though. A passive predator, like 
most oozes, a slimm responds to stimuli. It harms prey 
by exploding in reaction to damage. Then, it slowly 
reforms, attacking those in the path of its reconstitution.
salvage
A defeated slimm’s remains contain semiprecious stones 
worth 100 gp.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 This rare, amorphous 
creature explodes when damaged, splitting into smaller 
oozes. These small oozes can rejoin into a larger one 
again, which can then explode again.

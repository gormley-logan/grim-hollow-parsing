Ogresh
“Children love the ogresh living on the outskirts of town. 
She’s a rare flame in this dark world: a stranger you can trust.”
Big Size.
 An ogresh has wide features and a stout build. 
Apart from remarkable girth, ogresh are like humans 
in appearance. This similarity rarely allows them to pass 
as human, however, due to their sheer mass. Adoles-
cent ogresh are about as large as the largest humans 
while elder ogresh can weigh as much as three or 
four humans combined.
Their appetites match their mass. Ogresh wandering 
and integration traditions likely stem from the need to 
spread their population thinner. Lots of ogresh living 
together might have trouble providing for themselves. 
In a cosmopolitan setting, an ogresh stands out less, 
even with a big appetite.
Itinerant Youth.
 Ogresh spend their adolescence 
traveling. This journey develops social skills and ensures 
ample distance between the young ogresh and its elders. 
When a young ogresh encounters an elder during this 
time, the elder can hear about current affairs, and the 
youth can learn more of the history of their people.
Outsized Lives.
 Ogresh provide entertainment and 
counsel to others. These beings are a rare sight, and even 
rarer still is seeing more than one ogresh in a settlement. 
Ogresh have a knack for languages and learning 
customs, and they like to be good neighbors.

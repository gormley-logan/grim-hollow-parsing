GM Advice:
 The hraptnon is a great example of a “puzzle 
monster,” a beast that cannot be defeated until its secrets 
are revealed. Puzzle monsters can be a great deal of fun, 
especially to challenge extremely powerful parties. Just 
when the players think they’ve scored a potentially easy 
victory, they find that the threat remains.
The key to maximizing the impact of puzzle monsters 
like the hraptnon is to make sure not to reveal too much 
information too soon. Make the characters puzzle out the 
reality behind the monster, using resources and taking 
time to do so. When they are finally able to fully defeat the 
creature, their victory will be all the sweeter.

A central spike growing from the hraptnon can be fash-
ioned into a spear or lance by a proficient weaponsmith 
succeeding on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. This 
takes 10 days of work and 1000 gp of components. The 
spear or lance acts as a 
+3 weapon
 that does an additional 7 
(2d6) force damage on a successful hit. This magical weapon 
can affect the hraptnon, unlike other magical weapons.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 The hraptnon lives in 
the Stillborn Forest, and it has never been seen outside of 
the forest bounds.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 No magical spells or 
weapons can hurt the hraptnon, and its blood can spawn 
creatures known as xakalonus.
DC 25 Intelligence (History):
 The hraptnon cannot be 
permanently killed unless its heart, which rests in a magical 
pool in a grove at the center of the Stillborn Forest, is found 
and destroyed. This heart, known as the Stillborn Heart, 
could be sold to a sage for a large sum of gold.

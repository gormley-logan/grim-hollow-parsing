Daemon oak ichor is a powerful if unstable reagent. 
Harvesting one vial from a daemon oak requires a 
successful DC 20 Wisdom (Survival) check. One vial 
of ichor harvested from a daemon oak can fetch 500 gp 
from the right buyer.
Someone who has proficiency with smith’s tools can 
use the chains from one daemon oak to fashion a 
chain 
shirt of resistance
 (acid) or 
chain mail of resistance
 (acid). 
These armors also offer a +1 bonus to AC. Instead, the 
chains can be used to make a magic chain weapon (see 
Grim Hollow Player’s Guide
). Such a weapon offers a +1 
bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls, and when the 
wielder hits with an attack using such a weapon, it deals 
1d6 extra acid damage. Each of these rare items requires 
10 days and additional materials worth 1,000 gp to make.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Fell forces twisted this 
walking tree. It’s resistant to bludgeoning and piercing 
damage and vulnerable to fire.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature): 
A daemon oak can turn 
other trees into thralls. Each servant is nearly as powerful 
as its master, although far less cunning. A daemon oak 
thrall can’t spit acid like its master, and thralls perish if 
their master dies. When a thrall dies, it cracks apart, show-
ering acidic ichor over an area within 10 feet of the thrall.

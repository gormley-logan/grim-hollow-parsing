Stygian Bat
“Normal bats eat bugs to survive. Stygian bats 
will eat you, and they’ll do it for fun.”
Corrupted Predators
. Bats that dwell in places suf-
fused with the energy of death can absorb such power 
and become big, monstrous horrors. These creatures 
are not only far more aggressive and bloodthirsty than 
their tiny cousins, they’re also cruel. A stygian bat enjoys 
bringing death.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with leatherworker’s tools 
can fashion the hides of four stygian bats into a 
cloak of 
the stygian bat
 (see chapter 4). Doing so takes 5 days of 
work and materials worth 500 gp.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History): 
Where powerful 
undead creatures or other forces of death hold sway, 
normal bats can grow into blood-drinking monsters 
called stygian bats.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 Stygian bats are akin to 
giant bats, but they are cunning and cruel. They drink 
blood rapidly.
GM Advice:
 For an increased challenge for powerful characters, 
give the stygian bat the ability to grapple Medium and smaller 
creatures, and fly away with them. To make it reasonable, the 
stygian bat should only be able to fly at half speed when carrying 
a creature. And while this would let the bat carry a creature high 
into the air and drop it, this should only be done if you know that 
the players have resources to deal with that contingency, such as 
the 
feather fall
 spell.
Also note that while a stygian bat does not have the flyby trait, its 
swoop ability does allow it to knock targets prone, which means 
that flying away from a targeted creature would allow them to 
make opportunity attacks with disadvantage.

Ogre Swine
“That pig smells terrible… and… is it laughing at us?”
Big Pig.
 An ogre swine is a normal barnyard hog that 
has eaten too much humanoid flesh. Such pigs swell to a 
grotesque size. Their teeth, already good for an omnivorous 
diet, grow longer and more useful for cutting flesh.
Porcine Predator.
 Once transformed, an ogre swine 
often eats its fellows, escapes its enclosure, eats the farmer, 
and escapes into the wild. From there, it hunts more tasty 
humanoid morsels. It also eats offal and refuse, or almost 
anything even remotely edible. When not eating, an ogre 
swine wallows in filth to ease its aching skin, stretched 
taught over its bulk. The creature soon exudes a stench 
that, for some reason, ogres find tolerable.
Cursed Sapience.
 As the ogre swine transforms, it also 
gains humanoid characteristics. Its piggish cleverness grows 
into malicious cunning. It understands more. Vocalizations 
can sound more humanlike, from crying to laughter. And 
the pig’s hooves grow long and fingerlike.
salvage
Someone with proficiency with leatherworker’s tools 
can use the hides of five ogre swine to make 
pigskin armor
(see chapter 4). Doing so takes 3 days of work and other 
materials worth 100 gp.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Rumors swirl that the 
Baron of the Vale has a special breed of immense swine on 
the grounds of his keep in the Grey Peaks. They say folk 
there go hungry but the baron won’t butcher the herd.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 Few know that pigs 
fed a steady diet of humanoid flesh grow monstrous 
and take on humanoid features and mannerisms. Such 
an ogre swine is a filthy beast. Its stink can cause other 
creatures to retch. Its mouth festers with disease. And it 
kills people, feasts on them, and naps on their remains.

Thornhost
“I always carry a knife around these parts. Some 
of the plants around here have poison thorns, sure, 
but others have something far worse.”
Grisly Puppeteers.
 Often mistaken for zombies, 
thornhosts are parasitic plants that propagate through 
burrowing thorns. Once the thorns sink into flesh, they 
spread roots throughout the body, eventually controlling 
the still-living but brain-dead body of the host. This body 
withers as if from a wasting disease, and a thorny mass 
forms in the abdomen.
Walking Bomb.
 Once a thornhost has matured, the 
central mass swells and becomes unstable. The plant 
forces the body toward areas of high population, seeking 
to maximize the number of potential hosts. When its life 
becomes endangered, the plant bursts, shooting thorny 
seeds in all directions.
salvage
Thorns from a thornhost can be fashioned into darts or 
blowgun needles. Each thornhost produces 4d4 thorns 
useful for this purpose. Someone who has proficiency 
with smith’s tools or woodcarver’s tools can make the 
darts or needles. A creature struck by one of these darts 
or needles must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving 
throw at the end of their next turn or take 1d4 piercing 
damage as the semiliving thorn burrows in. A creature 
can prevent the extra damage by taking an action to 
remove the clinging dart point or needle. Each dart or 
needle functions this way only once and is ruined after 
use, its point missing.

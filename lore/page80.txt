Darkfeather
“A figure moves silently through the city, well past 
midnight, a masked doctor treating those who have contracted 
the Weeping Pox. Those who look closer see a monster—and 
not a masked healer—walking the streets.”
Mimic of Healers
. Darkfeathers are monsters that 
mimic the appearance of the few who try to safely help 
victims of the Weeping Pox. Traditionally, these healers 
dress in long, feathered black robes with a beak-like 
mask to protect themselves from contracting the disease. 
A warped mixture of magic and disease transformed 
these healers, merging the mask and pestilence, into a 
humanoid creature with a bird-like skull.
Deathbringer
. To some, darkfeathers might be a blessing. 
Within their skull are two poison glands and a proboscis 
to deliver the poison to sickened individuals. Victims of 
a darkfeather seem to improve for a couple of days after 
the creature’s visit, giving the family and victim hope. 
But death comes quickly, and the darkfeather tracks its 
victims to drink the liquified remains.
salvage
Glands within a darkfeather’s skull can be harvested and 
processed into one dose of a necrotic poison, which acts 
as a 
potion of poison
 that inflicts both poison and necrotic 
damage if invested. Harvesting and preparing the poison 
requires proficiency with a poisoner’s kit, takes 4 hours, 
and requires a successful DC 12 Intelligence check.

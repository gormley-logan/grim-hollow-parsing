D
Daemon Oak
“Twisted and tortured, the many faces of this walking, 
dark-barked oak scream and call as the creature moves 
through the forest, spreading destruction.”
Twisted Treants.
 Where daemon blood and ichor 
fall, feindish power ruins the ground. Plant life becomes 
desiccated and twisted, most falling to rot. But the 
hardiest plants become warped mockeries of their 
verdant kin. Among these are treants who become 
daemon oaks, which have elongated, lashing limbs 
and grasping roots, all bound in infernal chains.
Like a host of tormented souls attempting to free 
themselves from a woody prison, a multitude of faces 
manifest along the trunk of these animate trees. 
Some of these faces have a fixed place. Others emerge 
and then fade into the daemon oak’s despoiled bark.
Thrall Spawners.
 Daemon oaks can cause other trees 
to share their corruption. Instead of awakening trees, 
daemon oaks can replace wood and sap with acidic 
ichor. Once corrupted, a tree serves the daemon oak, 
amplifying the daemonic tree’s menace until the thrall is 
destroyed. Then, it explodes into a shower of acid.
Unrelenting Destroyers.
 Daemon oaks are sedentary 
creatures, drawing their nutrients from corrupted soil. 
They might stand for decades, wailing in some gloomy 
corner of deep woods, avoided by animals and sane folk 
alike. But when roused to action, they rarely stop their 
rampage until forced to do so.

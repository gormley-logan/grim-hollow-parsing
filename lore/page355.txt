Vooran
“When your pet stares at you, you never know if you are looking 
into the eyes of your beloved companion or the eyes of a vooran.”
Flesh Riding
. Vooran are uncontrollable incorporeal 
woodland spirits that experience the world by possessing 
small animals, causing those usually harmless creatures 
to behave strangely, even tamed ones.
Familiars
. Voorans can serve as familiars, though they 
generally only do so for those who offer it different animals 
to inhabit.
Ethereal Hedonist
. Voorans naturally inhabit the 
Ethereal plane and can only affect the mortal world for 
one hour a day while possessing a small animal; an hour 
they use to live life to the fullest.
salvage
If a vooran is destroyed while possessing an animal, the 
animal’s blood takes on an opalescent hue and gains 
momentary magical properties. If a living creature 
drinks the creature’s blood within 1 minute of its death, 
it acts as a 
potion of healing
.

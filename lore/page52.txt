Carvaloth
“When you spot one carvaloth, it’s already too late. 
The others are right behind you.”
Hidden Hunters.
 Carvaloths are ancient predators that 
possess the ability to change their skin color, much like 
a chameleon. This trait functions as camouflage, when 
stalking prey or hiding from other predators, and as a 
display of dominance toward other packs of carvaloths.
Strength in Numbers.
 A carvaloth’s fanged maw is 
filled with caustic spittle that eats through stone, metal, 
and flesh. A lone carvaloth is fierce and dangerous. 
In packs, these predators can quickly outnumber and 
overwhelm larger creatures.

GM Advice:
 Ancient vampires should be in a position where 
adventurers opposing them would have to go through several 
levels of challenge and danger just to get a clue that the ancient 
vampire even exists. Such a creature is strong and resourceful 
enough that it would be at the center of an entire campaign, 
and its reach would touch on a great number of schemes, plots, 
and intrigues. The ancient vampire would have created a vast 
number of spawn, young, and adult vampires that serve it. 
More importantly, entire groups or organizations would act 
on behalf of the ancient one. Assassin guilds, military groups, 
baronies or kingdoms, and entire church sects would, wittingly or 
unwittingly, be doing the work of the ancient vampire. And most 
importantly, heroes would have to survive the attention of all 
those groups, fighting their way through to the leadership, just to 
get an inkling that the ancient vampire is involved.

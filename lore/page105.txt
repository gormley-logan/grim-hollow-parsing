GM Advice:
 Want to tease your playerâ€™s a bit? When they 
defeat an ebon knight, have the steed remain alive. A player may 
want their character to bond with this powerful steed. But then 
what happens when the soul of the ebon knight living within the 
steed decides to make its presence known?
GM Advice:
 To up the challenge for a powerful party, make it 
impossible for the ebon knight to drop to 0 hit points if its steed 
is still alive, and vice versa. Force the characters to find a way to 
kill both knight and steed on the same attack

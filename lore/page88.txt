Disembodied
“It’s one thing to be stuck somewhere.
It’s another to be stuck in two places at once”
Ritual Disaster.
 The disembodied are survivors 
of a magic ritual that became a regional disaster. All 
people within and near the city of Ulmyr’s Gate when 
the incident occurred vanished from the face of Etharis. 
Years later, some returned, though each had a form 
indistinct to others. The disembodied claim they spent 
the intervening time stuck between planes, a claim which 
seems to be true, given the odd abilities the disembodied 
now possess.
Lost and Returned.
 For the disembodied, their 
vanishing and subsequent reappearance happened in the 
blink of an eye. Disembodied who weren’t members of 
the Great College attempted to pick their lives up where 
they left off, rebuilding the infrastructure of Ulmyr’s 
Gate or leaving to work their trade elsewhere. Those 
disembodied from the school of magic spend their time 
looking for a way to reverse the damage caused by the 
magic that transformed them.
Living Ghosts.
 People react to the disembodied with 
fear. In appearance and ability to travel between the 
Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane, the disembodied 
seem to be ghosts. Others also wrongly worry that the 
disembodied state might be contagious. Many shun 
close contact even when they recognize the disembodied 
aren’t incorporeal undead.
Those who returned struggle to regain some 
semblance of normalcy. Most disembodied have 
returned to their trades. Some, in their grief and rage, 
have turned to hunting spellcasters before they can do 
further harm.
Disembodied Arcanist.
 Disembodied arcanists 
were once the senior students and faculty of the Great 
College. Few took the magical calamity that changed 
them as a lesson in caution. Disembodied arcanists 
search for knowledge and artifacts to complete other 
rituals that might reverse or complete the ritual that 
transformed them

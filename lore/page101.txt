Dreamer eyelashes can be used to create a soothing tea 
that brings about deep sleep. The eyelashes of a dreamer 
can be had for 4 gp. Someone who has proficiency with 
an herbalism kit can add herbs worth another 1 gp and 
boil the mixture for 10 minutes. If the herbalist succeeds 
on a DC 10 Intelligence or Wisdom check, and if consumed 
within an hour of preparation, the tea induces restful sleep. 
The drinker must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution 
saving throw, which they can fail willingly, or sleep for 
8 hours, until they take damage, or until another creature 
uses an action to awaken them. If the drinker sleeps for 
8 hours and thereby finishes a long rest, the drinker can 
eliminate an extra level of exhaustion and gains 2 (1d4) 
temporary hit points until they finish another long rest. 
Making this tea requires eyelashes from both a dreamerâ€™s 
eyes. It takes one month for the lashes to grow back to 
sufficient length to use again.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Dreamers are an 
ancient people who survived into the current time by 
entering a stasis when their civilization was in jeopardy. 
A side effect of this stasis was collectively forgetting 
their history and culture.
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Dreamers are capable 
of sensing and entering the dreams of others nearby.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A tea that enhances 
sleep can be made from the eyelashes of a dreamer and 
dried herbs. The sleep induced by the tea is said to be 
more refreshing than natural rest.
GM Advice:
 Dreamers make excellent mystical advisors for foes 
looking for an edge in the realms of information and dreams. 
Dreamers might not even realize what their leader is really doing, 
as their focus is firmly in other realms of reality.

Gore Elemental
“The blood, flesh, sinew, and viscera congeal across 
the battlefield, taking a vaguely humanoid shape. 
Somewhere, Tormach is pleased.”
Tormach’s Glee
. The Arch Daemon Tormach revels 
in slaughter, and in places where death and carnage 
preside for an extended period, the concentration of 
bloodlust and death spawns a gore elemental. Cultists 
of Tormach may also summon such an elemental to do 
their gruesome bidding.
Mobile Sepulcher
. The gore elemental is little more than 
a barely sentient pile of the vilest remnants of battle: blood, 
rent flesh, broken bones, vomit, bile, and torn innards.
salvage
At the center of a gore elemental is a skull, which belonged 
to the most powerful creature that perished at the slaughter 
that created the gore elemental. With a successful DC 15 
Intelligence (Arcana) and 100 gp worth of components, 
one can create a 
talisman of Tormach
 (see Chapter 4). This 
process takes 8 hours.

Whelmer
“Helping people is all well and good on dry land, 
but you won’t see me diving to the rescue of 
anyone in the water. Not after last time.”
Illusory Lure.
 A corrupted water elemental, a whelmer 
likes to lurk in or near a body of water close to areas 
inhabited by humanoids. When people pass, a whelmer 
creates the illusion of a drowning person. Rather than wait 
in the water, the whelmer might rest motionless on a path 
to a beach or lake, waiting to ensnare would-be rescuers.
Fey Ties.
 The whelmers’ powers of illusion stem from 
fey ties. Some water elementals wanted to meddle in the 
realms of mortals. Curious about these strange creatures, 
fey saw a chance for mischief and taught these rogue 
elementals how to lure people with illusions.
Elemental Nature.
 A whelmer doesn’t require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.
salvage
If somebody casts 
gentle repose
 on the remains of a 
whelmer within 1 minute, someone who has proficien-
cy with alchemist’s supplies can boil the water down 
over 1 hour and add other materials worth 25 gp. If the 
alchemist succeeds on a DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom 
check, the result is one 
potion of water breathing
.

Dreamers
“Dreams are a simple reflection of our deepest 
yearnings. I make them reality.”
Strangers in a Strange Land.
 An ancient species 
that survived a cataclysm by entering sleep stasis, dreamers 
are still finding their footing in Etharis. They can recall 
little of their civilization prior to entering stasis, but the 
experience had a profound impact on them, granting 
them the ability to sense and enter the dreams of others. 
This ability has allowed dreamers to learn about the 
other people of their world, but their psychic intrusions 
have done little to endear dreamers to others.
The same stasis that allowed dreamers to survive a 
major calamity also caused them to forget most of their 
cultural history. Without a shared past, they split on 
whether to look forward or back. Some believe they 
should attempt to uncover the ruins of their civilization 
and resurrect its culture. Others see an opportunity to 
invent a new place in Etharis.
Dream Lives.
 Some dreamers can make a living in 
exchange for information discovered in dreams. Such 
dreamers enter dreams to obtain details about a person’s 
waking life they can later use as blackmail or sell to an 
interested third party.
Other dreamers have unlocked magical powers related 
to sleep and dreaming. Other people find dreamer power 
to enter dreams disconcerting. Some dreamers, such as 
somnolists, market this ability to fulfill customer fantasies. 
Their power over sleep can make them more dangerous 
than one might think a dream performer could be.

Gasper
“
While travelin’ in the wilds, pack more food’n water’n ya think 
ya need, keep yer tinder dry, and don’t disturb tranquil pools, 
as every wayfarer worth their salt knows.”
Sacred Sites.
 Powerful fey want certain pools, 
natural springs, and waterfalls to be left pristine and 
undisturbed. These fey created gaspers to ensure areas 
of sacred water remain undefiled. Gaspers don’t harm 
those who respect the water. They do attack those who 
pollute or defile the water or area near it.
Small Clues.
 Gaspers protect the area surrounding 
their sacred water by drowning and dissolving their 
victims. A cautious traveler might glimpse bits of bone 
in the water from those slain there. The gasper discards 
lost equipment where it won’t pollute the water. Anyone 
who disturbs the gasper’s sensitivities might notice their 
reflection in the water scowls at them just before the 
gasper attacks.
salvage
Water that fills a victim’s lungs and mouth while 
grappled by a gasper is expelled when the grapple is 
broken. If a creature took acid damage from the gasper 
and captures this water in a container, it can be used as 
a reagent for a 
potion of acid resistance
. Someone who has 
proficiency with alchemist’s supplies can brew the water 
with other materials worth 20 gp in a process that takes 
4 hours, making one dose of this potion.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 A gasper might attack 
anyone who it thinks has defiled the water it guards. 
Anything that happens in or near the water might provoke 
the creature.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 A gasper understands 
Sylvan but rarely speaks to those it deems enemies. 
But promising to leave a protected area might convince 
a gasper to cease attacking.

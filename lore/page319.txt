GM Advice:
 Vampires throughout fantasy rules rule the night. Soman vampires rule the day as well, as they are the leaders of the land. 
This makes Soman vampires much more dangerousâ€”not because of their martial or magical powers, but because of their political power. 
Anything that the characters might use to fight the powers of the Soman vampires will soon become outlawed in Soma, the possession or 
use of it punishable by death. Characters opposing the Soman vampire leaders might easily find themselves hunted by the very population 
they are trying to save and free from oppression.

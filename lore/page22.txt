The Great Beast
“The Great Beast is just a rumor—a story parents tell their children 
to keep them from wandering too far from home. It’s a crime to 
spread lies about the existence of the Beast. Also, it’s a crime to fail 
to report any sightings of the Beast to the proper authorities.”
True Rumors, False Verities
. No one knows when 
the Great Beast appeared on Etharis, because no one can 
confirm the Beast exists. Many claim to have seen the 
Beast, but when the sight of a thing causes madness, 
and when the many horrors on Etharis are mistaken for 
that thing, it’s impossible to ferret out the differences 
between fact and fiction.
Colossal Monstrosity
. When alleged eyewitnesses 
to attacks by the Beast come to any sort of consensus, 
they describe a towering, shadow-wreathed figure, as 
tall as the tallest cathedral spire. Its head is described as 
an enormous deer skull crowned with ever-branching 
antlers. Its elongated, emaciated, human-like body moves 
with unnatural grace when it is not stopping to destroy 
any living thing in its path. Its long limbs claw and grasp, 
eviscerating its terrified victims without care or mercy.
Corruption Made Flesh
. Many alleged sightings of 
the Beast end with shaken witnesses talking about seeing 
a gigantic hazy form towering above the foliage in the 
distance. The insubstantial form meanders across the 
landscape, phasing into and out of view at seemingly 
random intervals. Then the form disappears completely, 
fading to nothing.

GM Advice:
 The key to defeating a vampire is learning and 
exploiting its weaknesses while avoiding its strengths. A 
cautious vampire does everything in its power to hide those 
weaknesses. Unfortunately, players have access to fancy tomes 
detailing monsters that their characters do not have access to. 
Fortunately, GMs have their imaginations!
One way to keep players on their toes is to change some of the 
weaknesses and strengths for monsters, and a dragonborn 
vampire is an excellent candidate for change. With a 
connection to elements because of their draconic ancestries, 
dragonborn vampiresâ€™ stats can be changed to show that 
elemental affinity, or the perversion of it. For example, fire 
or cold damage instead of radiant damage may be needed 
to negate a red dragonborn vampires Regeneration.

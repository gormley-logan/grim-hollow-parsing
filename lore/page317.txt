DC 10 Intelligence (Religion):
 Soman vampires are 
undead who feed on the blood of the living by night and 
the hard work of the living by day. These vampires can 
pass as human and live according to rules. Other Soman 
vampires shun their fellows who give in to bloodlust or 
needlessly terrorize mortals.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 Like other vampires, 
Soman vampires canâ€™t enter dwellings unless invited. 
Sunlight bothers them, but only the elder Soman vampires 
suffer as much in sunlight as normal vampires do. These 
elders also have other weaknesses common to other 
vampires, such as being paralyzed by a stake to the heart. 
Many Soman vampires get around the home ban by owning 
the homes that their serfs and servants live in, giving the 
vampire freedom to enter at any time.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The gaze of elder 
Soman vampires is particularly insidious, allowing them 
to infiltrate and manipulate the minds of mortals. They 
use this ability to retain their aristocratic hold over the 
Soman population.

Hourglass Widow
“When the clock stops, your time has run out.”
Died Waiting. 
Popularly known as an hourglass widow, 
these undead are created when legendary heroes perish 
while waiting for a loved one to return. The anguish 
of waiting, and of the overwhelming fear of loss, trans-
forms the hero into a monster with the ultimate goal of 
destroying hope.
Control Time. 
An hourglass widow has a magical 
hourglass embedded in its chest that allows it mastery 
over time. It can speed itself up and ignore a 
slow
 spell or 
move freely in a 
time stop
.
Blitzing Attack. 
The widow’s ability to manipulate 
time allows it to unleash a devastating flurry of abilities 
before others can act.
salvage
When the sand from the widow’s hourglass is mixed 
with wine, it creates an elixir that when consumed 
prevents the creature from aging for 2d6 + 10 years. 
There is enough sand in the hourglass to create an elixir 
for two creatures. A creature cannot benefit from the 
sand of an hourglass widow more than once. The sand 
can be sold for 5,000 gp.

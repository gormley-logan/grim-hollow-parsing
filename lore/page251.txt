DC 13 Intelligence (Religion):
 Panjaians first appeared 
near the end of the Primordial’s war with the gods. Some 
scholars believe if panjaians had been created earlier, it 
might have changed the conflict’s outcome.
DC 13 Intelligence (Nature):
 Every panjaian has an 
affinity for the element of their Primordial patron. This 
affinity manifests in resistances, control over the element, 
and the ability to wield that element as a weapon.
GM Advice:
 Since a panjaian can be created from any type 
of humanoid creature, the stats shown here can be used as a 
template for adding powers to other creatures. For example, 
there’s nothing stopping you from creating an ogre ilharan. 
Creatures within the 4-8 CR range won’t become too powerful 
if given some of the traits of the panjaian. Creatures lower 
than CR 4 would become a CR 6 monster and should just use 
the regular panjaian stat block. Creatures of CR 9 or higher 
don’t gain much by adding the traits, but it could be a great 
mystery for the characters to unravel

salvage
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can brew and refine the blood of one quoxxarie with 
reagents worth 100 gp to make a 
potion of relentlessness
(see chapter 4). The process takes 8 hours, and the 
alchemist must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence or 
Wisdom check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 The four kinds of 
quoxxarie are distinguished by their different colors. Red is 
the most common, while gray is the deadliest and rarest.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 Quoxxaries are 
aggressive, fast, and ruthless. They respond to attacks 
with crushing blows and are impossible to poison.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Four quoxxaries of 
differing colors fighting alongside one another makes a 
deadly combination. Their auras complement each other, 
spelling big trouble for the quoxxaries’ enemies.
GM Advice:
 Overlapping auras of quoxxaries can be both 
powerful and difficult to keep track of, potentially slowing 
combat. Use them with care. On the other hand, a powerful 
party that might be difficult to challenge in combats should 
find multiple quoxxaries can be part of a very tough fight.

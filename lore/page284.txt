Remorseful Storm
“If you venture into the Unterland province and hear a sound 
that’s a terrible cacophony of thunder and wailing—RUN.”
A Storm Unleashed
. This storm giant took up Maligant’s 
call to arms during the war between the Four Divines. 
Once part of a celestial host, it’s now a lost veteran and 
skilled holy warrior who hunts down fiends and anyone 
who gets in its path. People who’ve seen it call it the 
“Remorseful Storm.”
Depraved Paladin
. Driven by a strict adherence to its 
own unmoored sense of morality, it tracks down and faces 
its rivals at any cost. It wanders the Unterland province, 
seeking to find and destroy followers of Tormach. And 
often it believes everyone follows Tormach.
Rampages of Regret
. The Remorseful Storm’s morals 
have become corrupted by its solitude as deeply as its 
sorrow has intensified. Its remorse for divine loss results 
in lashing out, while often apologizing as it does.

GM Advice:
 The Remorseful Storm might gain followers who 
share its mania for chasing down supposed evil-doers. It might 
provide a benefit similar to its Relentless Zeal to them, giving the 
characters a hint at what they might face later.

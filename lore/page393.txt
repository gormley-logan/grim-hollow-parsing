GM Advice:
 Dwarf vampires should be particularly 
dangerous, as they can hide in lairs deep underground. 
Passing easily through the earth, they have access to areas 
that heroes might find hard to reach. Remember, though, 
that these vampires need access to blood, so they must 
come out of their hiding places as some point.

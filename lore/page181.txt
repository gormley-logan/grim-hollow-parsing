GM Advice:
 The kokela is an entity that is a mere reflection of 
the horror brought by the Aether Kindred, but that doesn’t mean 
it isn’t powerful. Living creatures in the vicinity of the slumbering 
kokela are constantly agitated, as the hum of the kokela’s song 
slowly eats away at their psyches. Characters may find creatures 
in this area more hostile than normal. Also, the “chosen one” does 
anything in its power to find the source of the song.

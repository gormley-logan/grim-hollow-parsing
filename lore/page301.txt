Shadow Mauler
“The worst monsters are those you don’t see coming.”
Shadow Predator.
 Shadow maulers are weird 
predators with multiple eyes and multiple fanged 
mouths that can extend from the body on ephemeral 
flesh. They conceal themselves in the dark, waiting to 
kill any living creature that crosses their path. Cruel 
and calculating, a shadow mauler prefers to attack 
creatures alone or isolated from a group.
Born to Darkness.
 Sunlight is the bane of a shadow 
mauler. The monsters might have originated from a 
place without such light. They dwell in lightless spots to 
avoid sunlight, which hinders their abilities, preventing 
them from being effective hunters.
salvage
The ephemeral flesh of a shadow mauler is a silklike sub-
stance that appears to be made of shadow. Someone who 
has proficiency with leatherworker’s tools or weaver’s 
tools can fashion a 
cloak of elvenkind
 from this material. 
Doing so takes 3 days and other materials worth 50 gp. 
This cloak loses its magic if exposed to sunlight for 8 
hours or more.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Shadow maulers are 
most potent in shadows. In sunlight, they become more 
solid and easier to hurt. They also have a hard time 
seeing, fighting, escaping, and hiding.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The shadow mauler 
weakness to sunlight extends to a vulnerability to 
radiant damage.

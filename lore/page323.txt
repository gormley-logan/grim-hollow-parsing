Ghost Mustang
“The faint stench of death surrounds a translucent horse, 
a pale glow shining where its eyes should be. An ornate 
saddle jingles as it stomps in place.”
Necromancer Steeds.
 Ghost mustangs are the favored 
mounts of necromancers, who often create these horses 
as an early experiment in mastering the arts of undeath. 
While loyal to their creator, a ghost mustang avoids the 
afterlife and endangers itself only if ordered to do so.
Ritual Creation.
 Ghost mustangs are ectoplasmic 
manifestations of wild horses that died of unnatural 
means. A spellcaster with at least one 4th-level spell 
slot can enact this ritual, using materials worth 5,500 
gp, which the ritual consumes. A wizard of the school 
of necromancy must instead be 5th level. In a ritual 
performed at night, the creator creates a 
magic circle
around the slain horse and places a drop of the creator’s 
blood in each eye. The creator then incants for 6 hours. 
The body disappears during the ritual, and the ghost 
mustang appears to serve the creator 13 days later.
Undead Nature.
 A ghost mustang doesn’t require 
air, food, drink, or sleep.
salvage
The ghost mustang disappears when it dies, leaving 
behind puddles of ectoplasm. This substance can be used 
to brew a 
potion of invisibility
 when combined with a hair 
from the creator’s head and materials worth 100 gp. 
This process requires proficiency with alchemist’s supplies, 
a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)
check, and 
8 hours of work.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion):
 A ghost mustang is 
undead, made of corporeal ectoplasm. It has related 
immunities and resistances, and it’s hard to kill.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A ghost mustang is 
vulnerable to radiant damage, and that type of damage 
can keep the steed from surviving a killing blow.

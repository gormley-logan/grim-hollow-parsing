Mausgeist
“
“In the case of the mausgeist, the pursuit of  
power corrupts in ways only a fiend knows.”
Fiendish Rodent.
 A mausgeist appears when a powerful 
spellcaster makes an infernal pact for immortality. Magic 
imbues each of a mausgeist’s long whiskers, making the 
creature a deadly opponent.
A mausgeist hungers for humanoid flesh, wandering 
cemeteries at night to dig up hearts and livers to feast upon. 
Breaking the curse of a mausgeist’s existence requires it 
to refrain from killing or devouring humanoid flesh 
for a thousand days.
Shifty Appearance.
 A mausgeist can change its appear-
ance through magical means. The creature retains some 
rodent characteristics even in humanoid form.
Jungeist.
 A jungeist is a mausgeist before any pact 
gives it more power. This fiend is still a formidable foe, 
but it’s easier to dispatch than a mausgeist.
salvage
A mausgeist is a creature born of a hunger for undying 
power. Its remains can be harvested for their magical 
properties. Within the liver of a mausgeist is a 
pearl of power
.
Someone who has proficiency with leatherworker’s 
tools or weaver’s tools can incorporate the hide of a 
mausgeist into a 
cloak of the mausgeist
 (see chapter 4). 
Doing so requires 10 days of work, extra materials 
worth 2,000 gp, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence 
(Arcana)
check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A mausgeist is a 
fiend immune to poison and resistant to weapons that 
aren’t silvered.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 A mausgeist can take 
humanoid form, but it still resembles a rodent in such a 
disguise. Even in that form, each of the fiend’s whiskers 
can create a magical effect.

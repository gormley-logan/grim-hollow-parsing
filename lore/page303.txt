lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion)
: Those who use Shad-
owsteel to power curses can become Shadowsteel ghouls 
upon death. These undead creatures seek out more of 
the metal. As the creature ages, it can regain a semblance 
of the arcane power it had in life, empowering similar 
creatures and cursing nearby foes.

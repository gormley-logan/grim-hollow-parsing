Animated 
Flame Tongue
“A sword that flies around by itself is already quite frightening. 
Adding fire to the mix sure doesn’t make it better.”
Flourishing Blades
. 
Infused with arcane life, animated 
flame tongues dance through the air leaving trails of 
embers behind them as they seek foes to slay. Animated 
flame tongues fight with the skill of a seasoned duelist.
Honorbound. 
Animated flame tongues can be created 
in many ways, but the most common way is when a 
magical sword’s attuned wielder is killed with magical 
fire. The sword becomes mobile and semi-sentient, 
seeking to defeat those who killed its master, and anyone 
who uses magic to destroy life. This makes animated 
flame tongues a particular risk to those who wield magic.
Constructed Nature. 
An animated flame tongue 
doesn’t require air, food, drink, or sleep. The magic that 
animates an animated flame tongue is dispelled when 
the construct drops to 0 hit points. An animated flame 
tongue reduced to 0 hit points becomes inanimate and is 
too damaged to be of much use or value to anyone.
salvage
The animated flame tongue is made from an enchanted 
metal. Someone who collects four animated flame tongues 
can craft a 
+1 longsword 
This requires a proficient weap-
onsmith to succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check 
after working for 24 hours and using 250 gp of components. 
It’s rumored that the longswords can be turned into 
flame tongues again with the proper ritual, but no one has 
confirmed those rumors yet.

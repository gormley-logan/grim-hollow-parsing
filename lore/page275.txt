behold. They are vaguely humanoid with grey pebbled 
skin, a large ovoid head, sharp claws, and a massive, 
fanged maw.
Silent Hunters
. Quiet ones always generate an aura of 
absolute silence.
Feed On Fear

their victims as much as possible before killing them.
salvage
The brain of a quiet one can be made into a meal for 
three people with a successful DC 10 Intelligence check 
by someone proficient with cook’s utensils. Consuming 
the brain within 24 hours of the quiet one’s death gives 
the eater advantage on saving throws against effects 
that cause the frightened condition for 1 week. Crafting 
this meal takes 2 hours and costs 20 gp.

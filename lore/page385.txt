GM Advice:
 Bugbear vampires play a strange role in the 
history of their kind. Having already succumbed to Tormach’s 
Rage, bugbears are fearsome killers. Those bugbears who 
succumb to vampirism take on new powers, but they no 
longer fit into the plans of Tormach. Different groups of 
normal bugbears might treat a bugbear vampire much 
differently. Some might assume the vampirism is another 
blessing from Tormach, while others might see it as a 
corruption. Adventurers might easily find themselves 
caught in a struggle between a group of bugbears and 
a bugbear vampire’s followers.

Daemon Skull Soul Vessel
The ancient daemon skull that serves as Gegazol’s soul 
vessel possesses infernal power, giving it the means for 
mischief and self-preservation. It has AC 6, but it’s immune 
to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from non-
magical attacks, as well as cold, fire, necrotic, and psychic 
damage. It’s immune to all conditions, and it has a +7 
bonus to all saving throws, making saves against spells and 
magical effects with advantage. The skull has 200 hit points.
When harmed, the skull sends out a psychic alarm. 
Gegazol and her Immortals can sense this alarm, provided 
they are on the same plane of existence. Also, when a 
creature deals the skull damage, that creature must succeed 
on a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw or take psychic damage 
equal to half the damage the creature dealt.
If her soul vessel is destroyed, Gegazol can’t rejuvenate. 
When her body is destroyed again, she dies.

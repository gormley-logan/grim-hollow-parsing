Creating Other Hungerer Beasts
Hungerer beasts are monstrosities that resemble their 
natural counterparts. A hungerer beast is tougher, which 
translates to more hit points and stronger attacks. Hun-
gerer beasts are also more aggressive and less likely to 
flee when wounded. Uniting these monsters is the Tears 
of the Hungerer trait. Use the creatures here, compared 
to their animal likenesses, as a guide to creating other 
hungerer beasts.
Two traits are very appropriate for a hungerer beast. 
Aggressive.
 As a bonus action, the beast can move 
up to its speed toward a hostile creature it can see.
Blood Frenzy.
 The beast has advantage on melee 
attack rolls against any creature that doesnâ€™t have all its 
hit points.

DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 The Champions of Filth 
are a sect of knights who revere disease. They believe 
that sickness plays an important role in the cycle of 
life and death, weeding out the weak and allowing the 
strong to flourish.
DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine):
 Champions of Filth allow 
themselves to be infected with any disease they encounter, 
treating it as a rite of passage that leaves them stronger 
than before. They are immune to these plagues, but they 
can be dangerous carriers.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The strongest 
Champions of Filth, the blightwalkers, are so infested 
with disease that any contact with their magic or 
weapons can cause flesh to wither away.
GM Advice:
 Champions of filth obviously have a 
twisted concept of what disease means, thinking of it as 
purifying rather than corrupting. This makes them easily 
manipulated, and perfect minions for a greater threat 
that uses diseaseâ€”or even just tricks the champions 
into thinking that they believe the same things. A group 
of blightwalkers, all casting blight at the same time on 
enemies, can be a potent killing force.

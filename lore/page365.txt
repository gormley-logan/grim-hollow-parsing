“Three wolves attacked in unison, and we focused our attacks 
on the one we thought was the leader. But it refused to die no 
matter how many times we hit it.”
Beast’s Corruption.
 The mutative powers of the 
Beast spawn terrible creatures, but one of the more 
unusual is the wolfentroika. When the Beast corrupts 
a wolf carrying unborn pups, the wolf gives birth to

salvage
The acid glands of a wolfentroika trio contain magic. 
Someone with proficiency in the Medicine skill succeeding 
on a DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check can harvest these 
glands within 1 hour of death. Somebody who has pro-

all three wolfentroikas from one trio to create a 
potion of 
life sharing
 (see chapter 4). Making the potion takes 1 day 
of work and reagents worth 200 gp, and the alchemist 
must succeed on a DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom check 
to create the potion.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Where the presence of 
the Beast has been rumored, mutated wolves with acidic 
saliva might be encountered. These giant monstrosities 
come in trios, and they are notoriously difficult to kill.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 ): A wolfentroika trio 
works perfectly together, better than a wolf pack.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Wolfentroikas share 
life force and consciousness. What one knows, the others 
know. To kill one, you must kill all three within seconds. 
To affect one with certain types of magic, you must affect 
all simultaneously.

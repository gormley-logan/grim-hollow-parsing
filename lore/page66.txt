College of Requiems
“It was the most horrible thing I ever heard. It was beautiful.”
Conductors of Death.
 Bards devote their lives to 
mastering the alluring and compelling power of song, 
yet a few dour individuals turn their efforts to extending 
that power into the realm of death. Blending necromancy 
into their music allows them to tear at life force or 
animate the dead.
Soul Music.
 Bards who focus on necromancy call corpses 
out of the ground to serve them, dancing to their mournful 
tune. As undead servants advance, the bard sows chaos 
among enemies, hampering their defenses and turning 
them against one another. By the time they regroup, the 
dead are upon them.

Performers from the College of Requiems use master-
work instruments of bone and ivory. Each instrument 
has a distinctly sorrowful sound. Someone who has 
proficiency with the instrument has advantage on Charisma 
checks to use it to play a dirge or similar mournful tune. 
Each instrument is worth 25 gp times the Challenge 
of the performer it belonged to, but only an expert in 
instruments is likely to recognize the value.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Bards of the College 
of Requiems turn their arts to necromancy. Most prefer 
a solitary existence, perhaps in the company of the dead.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 By weaving necromancy 
into their music, these spellcasters raise undead minions 
and hinder their enemies with curses and enchantments. 
Confronting one of these bards can mean fighting 
through their undead allies first.

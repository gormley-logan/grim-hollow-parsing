Hell’s Reach
“When the imps start to fight in the full moon’s light
The wise witch knows soon the hell’s reach grows.”
Although no larger than a sizable mushroom, a hell’s reach 
has a touch of infernal origin. Six red tentacles remain 
hidden in a fungal dome until a passerby disrupts the 
mushroom’s slumber. Then, the tentacles erupt from 
the mushroom to attack, reeking of rotting flesh. Each 
tentacle contains juices that react with air to ignite. When 
the mushroom is damaged, this liquid squirts from it.
Ring of Fire.
 A cluster of hell’s reaches is called a ring 
of fire. It’s best avoided, much like a fairy circle.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies or 
an herbalism kit can use the remains of one ring of fire (or 
about a dozen hell’s reaches) and reagents worth 25 gp to 
brew an oil that can be applied to armor in 10 minutes. One 
dose of this oil conveys resistance to fire damage to the armor 
and to the wearer while the armor is worn for 24 hours after 
the oil is applied. Brewing the oil requires 4 hours of work 
and a successful DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Hell’s reach is immune 
to fire. The liquid within the mushroom is flammable 
and bursts forth when the mushrooms take damage.

Rime Hungers
“You almost feel sorry for them. Freezing to death is a bad way 
to go, but they did something to cause their state. And they 
hunger for warm flesh. I think you get my point.”
Rime-Covered Corpses. 
Rarely straying far from 
where they died and never willingly wandering into 
areas of warmth and sunlight, rime hungers are frost-
covered, sickly blue corpses that haunt frozen regions 
in continuous search for victims.
Hungry Dead. 
Rime hungers devour all forms of living 
flesh but crave that of sapient creatures. It’s believed 
their undead state is a curse brought on by cannibalism 
they engaged in to stave off their original demise.
Persistent Shamblers. 
While they are slow and 
will not follow their prey into warm lands, rime hungers 
track prey with the persistence of the dead while in 
colder lands.
Undead Nature. 
A rime hunger doesn’t require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.
salvage
Rime hungers sometimes carry the treasures they had in 
life. Some sages claim a rime hunger tongue dissolves in 
a 
potion of cold resistance
, doubling the potion’s duration. 
However, many alchemists consider this claim to be bunk.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A rime hunger is 
immune to cold and vulnerable to fire damage. It can’t 
be poisoned.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 One should avoid 
the grasp of rime hungers. They can feed on the life and 
warmth of creatures they hold, which strengthens the 
rime hunger.

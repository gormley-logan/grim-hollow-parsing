Braerog
“If you go into the woods alone, you ought to go prepared. 
Things that creep on the forest floor might insist you tread 
lightly—or not at all.”
Thorny Traps.
 Lurking in the deepest reaches of 
forests, braerogs represent some of the last glimmers of 
the world before shadow descended upon Etharis. These 
creatures fiercely protect the vestiges of woodlands 
unsullied by evil.
Tree Travelers.
 Braerogs are one with the forests that 
surround them and magically move through trees. This 
mode of travel allows them to disappear and reappear 
over short distances.
Mischievous Minions.
 Braerogs have a penchant for 
mischief. A braerog sighting was once a sure sign that a 
more powerful guardian of the forest was nearby. Without 
the oversight of such a master, braerogs act unchecked.
salvage
A braerog has claws of thorns. Someone who has proficiency 
in woodcarver’s tools can craft a 
staff of briars
 (see chapter 4) 
from the claws of ten braerogs. Creating this item takes 
10 days and other materials worth 100 gp, and someone 
must cast 
entangle
 on the staff each day during its creation.

Coldfire Ooze
“Coldfire’s a menace, sure, but at least it doesn’t move around 
on its own. Why are you staring at me like that?”
Spreading Corruption.
 Coldfire oozes spread 
coldfire throughout the north. Corrupted slurries of 
ice and snow, coldfire oozes have become a menace to 
frontier towns among the Valikan Clans.
Burning Slime.
 Those who first faced coldfire oozes 
didn’t realize how the slimes could split. This mistake in 
the first skirmishes allowed the oozes to further multiply. 
Now, they can be found all over the northern wilds.
Ooze Nature.
 A coldfire ooze doesn’t require sleep.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can use the remains of one coldfire ooze to make one 
flammable tincture
 (see chapter 4). Making the tincture 
takes 1 day of work, materials worth 50 gp, and a successful 
DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Coldfire oozes are rare 
creatures that spread coldfire.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 As with coldfire, fire is 
the best way to deal with a coldfire ooze. Fire is the only 
way to put the coldfire out.

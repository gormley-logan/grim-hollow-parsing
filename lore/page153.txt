Hermit Skull
“Your first instinct might be to laugh. When it’s 
close enough to see the hatred burning in its eye 
sockets, another instinct is likely to take over.”
Hatred Reborn.
 A hermit skull belonged to a person 
so hateful that the hate reanimated the spirit after 
death. Lacking the power to animate a whole body, this 
monster’s six oozing, ectoplasmic limbs extend from the 
skull as it scuttles around in search of life to destroy. In 
this task, the hermit skull is cunning enough to burrow 
into soil and wait for prey to pass nearby. Then, the 
skull attacks.
Undead Nature
. 
A hermit skull doesn’t require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.

lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion):
 Strong negative 
emotions in a living creature can cause them to rise again 
as an undead creature when they die. A hermit skull 
rises when a dying person has enough hatred in their 
heart to animate their remains, but only enough power is 
available to animate their skull.
DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Hermit skulls lash out with 
their ectoplasmic limbs, which rot flesh and sap vitality.

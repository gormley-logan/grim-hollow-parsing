DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Wechselkinds are fey 
creations made to imitate humanoid children.
DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine):
 Wechselkinds have 
resistance to poison damage and are immune to 
disease. They do not need to eat, drink, or breathe.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Elements of a 
wechselkindâ€™s remains can be used to discover the 
hidden paths between Etharis and the fey realms.
GM Advice:
 A group of wechselkind can make a great 
challenge for your characters. Their ability to look like 
children can lull heroes into a false sense of security. The 
small constructs can fool characters, coaxing them into 
dangerous situations that allow for the wechselkind to 
swarm and sneak attack to great effect. Add a glamourist to 
the mix, and the group becomes even more dangerous.

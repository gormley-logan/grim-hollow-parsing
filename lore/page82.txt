Death Cap
“It draped over her head, and everything changed. 
That insecure bard we all knew and loved was gone. She sliced 
through us as if we were butter.”
Deadly Spirit
. The death cap is the manifestation of 
an executioner’s or assassin’s spirit, who not only killed 
without remorse, but hungered for murder. Their spirit 
and dark hunger live on after death, coalescing into some 
form of a cap or a hat.
Patiently Waiting Release
. These caps are slow 
movers—landbound slitherers. It spends most of its time 
patiently waiting for prey, seeming nothing more than 
a clean but discarded item of clothing made of a lush 
material. It doesn’t reveal its true nature until someone 
dons the hat.
Psychic Hijacker
. Once upon a living creature’s head, 
the transformation begins as the hood attempts to control 
the mind of its host. When it does, it stretches into a deep 
black hood, and that’s when the carnage begins.
Parasitic Killer
. The cap wants nothing more than to 
slake its murderous desires. While it can be cunning, it 
rarely passes on an opportunity to kill. It kills its host by 
pushing it into battle and psychically draining the host’s 
life force.
Undead Nature
. A death cap doesn’t require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.

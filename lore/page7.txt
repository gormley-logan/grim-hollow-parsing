DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Aberrant horrors are 
the results of failed arcane experiments that twist the 
body into unnatural forms.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Each aberrant horror 
is different. Some grow extra limbs, others dissolve 
into oozelike creatures, and others swell to massive 
proportions. They contain eldritch energy that can fuel 
necromancy and transmutation.

GM Advice:
 The arcane origins of aberrant horrors give you 
a great deal of room to challenge your players with unusual 
traits. For example, one horror might only take damage when 
itâ€™s under the effects of a bane or bless spell, but ferreting out 
this information requires the characters to face it once and 
succeed on a DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana) check. The secret 
to pulling this off is to make the odd traits easy to learn and 
possible to accomplish without overly taxing the characters.

GM Advice:
 For areas of Etharis that you want to make 
seem creepy or different, you can turn flatback beetles 
into beasts of burden or plow animals. For example, some 
backwater hamlet in Soma might breed these monstrous 
insects specifically and think nothing of it.
GM Advice:
 Eye crows are a wonderful tool for GMs to 
deliver cryptic messages or clues to the characters, even 
as they are trying to peck out the eyes of the heroes. They 
make wonderful, creepy additions to encounters.

The nest of an eye crow contains glittering baubles, 
coins, gems, or jewelry worth at least 5 gp. Feathers of 
one eye crow can fetch a similar amount of money.

DC 10 Wisdom (Nature):
 Eye crows can be tamed and 
trained for simple tasks. Unscrupulous trainers teach the 
crow to attack others, going for the eyes.

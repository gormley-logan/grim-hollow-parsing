The scent glands of a nacambra contain a toxin. Harvesting 
the glands without releasing noxious fumes requires a 
successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine or Survival) check 
by someone who has proficiency with a poisoner’s kit. 
The poisonous substance can then be mixed with fortified 
wine and turned into a 
potion of poison
 with a successful 
DC 15 Intelligence check in one hour using the kit.

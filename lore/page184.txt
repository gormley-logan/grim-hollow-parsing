 The laneshi call their domain the 
Llana’Shi Empire. For most of its history, the leaders 
of the empire showed no interest in the activities of 
surface-dwelling peoples or the events of the surface

warrior caste and mystic caste. Warriors have dominion 
over all that lives while mystics have responsibilities related 
to the dead and objects that never lived.

undertakers, and artisans.
Necromancer Twins. 
Each laneshi necromancer is a 
twin. The older of the two is allowed to live while the 
younger twin is sacrificed and has its spirit bound to the

The Great College was home to a large collection of 
magic items. The disembodied somehow recovered some 
of these objects. A disembodied commoner might carry 
one common or uncommon magic item. A disembodied 
arcanist can possess a few such items or one rare one.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 The disembodied 
were once the citizens of a city known as Ulmyr’s Gate. 
It housed a school of magic called the Great College, 
but an arcane accident destroyed the metropolis and 
institution. Years later, citizens of Ulmyr’s Gate and staff 
and students at the Great College began to reappear, 
transformed into the disembodied.
DC 13 Intelligence (Nature):
 Beasts and other 
creatures inside and around Ulmyr’s Gate suffered 
the same fate as the humanoids that lived in the city. 
Although much rarer, some of these creatures have 
returned to the region and show innate magical abilities 
like those of the disembodied.
DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The disembodied can 
step into the Ethereal Plane. They can also call on magic 
related to their partially immaterial state.
GM Advice:
 Other NPCs or creatures may have disembodied 
traits. For example, a fighter or paladin, or even a monstrous 
creature, could be made into a disembodied version by giving 
them traits similar to the disembodied commoner. A foe’s ability 
to use blink or blur—in addition to entering an ethereal state—
can make for an interesting new challenge.

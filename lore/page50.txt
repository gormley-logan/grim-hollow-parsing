Caprathorn
“The temptation to aid a lost lamb should be tamped 
down when a thornlamm appears. Where there is one, 
there are many. And all lead back to a creature far more 
terrifying than any big, bad wolf.”
Malevolent Caprid.
 The caprathorn is a fiendish creature, 
born out of corruption by the Great Beast. Though gangly, 
a caprathorn is a legendary foe.
Runic Horns.
 The caprathorn’s head is topped with four 
twisted horns. These horns are covered with arcane sigils 
and are the source of its legendary powers. Attached to 
these horns, growing from vines, are thornlamms, miniature 
versions of the caprathorn. These creatures serve the fiend 
as minions and food.

be controlled and taken. At the start of each day there is 
a 2% chance the sphere disappears forever.

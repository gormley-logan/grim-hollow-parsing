GM Advice:
 The social nature of halflings puts them in a 
strange position. Theyâ€™re more likely than most vampires to 
be found interacting with society, meaning more opportunity 
to feed. They must then rely on their luck and cunning to stay 
hidden, as opposed to relying to hidden, isolated lairs.

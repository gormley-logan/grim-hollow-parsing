Drab Sludge
“Their stench fills your nostrils and cloys in the mouth. 
I wish that were the worst thing about these disgusting sludges.”
Smelly Sliders
. It’s difficult to describe the repulsive 
stench that emanates from a drab sludge. It’s like something 
between a day’s old corpse and a rancid latrine, and 
somehow worse. And the way this deep brownish-green 
muck sloshes upon surfaces, making a roiling and splashing 
sound akin to that produced by propelled vomit, only adds 
to its disgusting nature. These sludges seem more liquid than 
other oozes, but they can slosh on walls and ceilings in 
inexplicable ways, adding to their strange and revolting nature.
Unrelenting Splitters
. As if its rancid being weren’t 
horrid enough, these oozes split into smaller oozes. 
When they do, their stench changes, as if sacks of 
fouler-smelling stuff are torn open in the process.
Ooze Nature
. A drab sludge doesn’t require sleep.
salvage
The smell of a drab sludge is so powerful it can revive 
the unconscious. Using the remains of a drab sludge, 
someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can make a 
resuscitation bomb
 (see chapter 4). Doing so 
requires materials worth 50 gp, 4 hours of work, and a 
successful DC 13 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature)
: These sludges emit a 
terrible smell that sickens those who venture near.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana)
: Damage eventually 
causes a drab sludge to split, which unleashes an altered 
stench, forcing those around it to contend with smaller 
but nearly as potent oozes.

Dwarf Vampire
“Dwarves delve, even when they’re dead 
and need blood to survive.”
Earth Bound.
 Vampirism amplifies the dwarven 
connection to earth and stone, awakening ancient elemen-
tal connections in the dwarf’s bloodline. Dwarf vampires 
burrow like ghosts passing through walls, and instead 
of turning to mist when near death, they meld into the 
nearest earth or stone. Similarly, a person slain by a dwarf 
vampire’s bite spontaneously sinks into the ground.
Silver Scorned.
 For some reason, the corruption of 
vampirism makes dwarves susceptible to silver. They 
dislike its presence near them, and wounds from silver 
weapons slow the vampire’s healing. A silver spike 
through the vampire’s heart is a sure way to destroy 
them, although unlike other vampires, wood isn’t useful 
in that regard.
salvage
Dwarf vampires often display avarice. They collect 
treasure with zeal. Most wear numerous valuable objects 
and pieces of jewelry, eschewing anything silver.
Someone who eats the tongue of an adult or older 
dwarf vampire gains no ability to speak with beasts 
but can instead speak to nonmagical, unworked earth 
or nonmagical stone for 10 minutes. These substances 
can tell what creatures have been within 10 feet of them 
within the last 24 hours, as well as what they conceal, if 
anything. Earth and stone have limited perspective but 
offer as much information as they are asked for.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Dwarf vampires 
spend their time hunting prey or wealth, preferably 
under the ground. 
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Vampirism connects a 
dwarf strongly to the earth. The vampire can meld into 
earth and stone and travel through it. They do so when 
near death, hiding in the earth to heal.
DC 20 Intelligence (Religion):
 Silver irritates a dwarf 
vampire and makes their wounds slow to heal. But 
poison is ineffective against a dwarf vampire, and only 
the most faithful can hope to turn one.

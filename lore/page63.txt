DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 A chiropteran behemoth 
serves Grand Duke Koshevek of Soma. This behemoth is 
the only one whose existence has been verified.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The ritual that created 
the chiropteran behemoth makes it regenerate even 
when it should die. However, any mortal magic can be 
undone. The behemoth’s leavings—skin, fur, broken 
teeth, and guano—found in its lair need to be studied 
to learn the behemoth’s weakness.
DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana):
 To create the elixir 
that can render the chiropteran behemoth vulnerable 
to death requires its guano—see Salvage.

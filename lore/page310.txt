Sleep Gulper
“Like everything in the unnatural realms, the evil fey try to 
take everything from you. Whether it’s your money, or all your 
insides, even the smallest of creatures will be greedy.”
Greedy Monsters
. Sleep gulpers hide in the sewers 
and middens of populated areas, waiting to find a lone 
creature to attack or sneaking into bedrooms to plague 
sleeping victims.
Sleep Tight
. The sleep gulpers use the long thin stinger 
on their back end to stab prey. A paralytic magic hinders 
the victim, making it easier for the sleep gulper to latch 
onto the nearest foe. They settle for pets and other animals, 
but they savor the sweet taste of humanoid essence.
Agile and Adaptive
. Thanks to the sleep gulper’s leech-
like body, spider legs, and bat wings, the sleep gulper has 
many ways to travel. Whether climbing, swimming, or 
flying—they can go anywhere at any time.
salvage
A sleep gulper’s stinger has magic in its poke. If someone 
collects 30 sleep gulper stingers, they can craft a 
wand of 
paralysis
. This requires a proficient arcanist to succeed on 
a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana), crafting the wand in 
10 days and using 2000 gp of components.

Worms-in-the-Walls
“It was hideous! Hundreds of writhing worms 
squeezed from the walls and swarmed over poor 
Mugsy. His screams didn’t last long.”
Creatures from Beyond
. Most hope the Aether 
Kindred slumber still, but the disgusting creatures 
known as worms-in-the-walls have been seen with an 
alarming frequency near places of learning or powerful 
magic. Their ties to the Aether Kindred are irrefutable.
Hidden Infestations
. These gray-colored worms are 
roughly 1 foot long and exceedingly thin. They hide in the 
walls of old decrepit buildings, especially dwellings where 
arcane magic suffuses the area. They can merge, creating 
fast-moving swarms with frightening intelligence.
Alien Minds
. These worms can speak telepathically and 
mentally assault threats. Strange markings are carved 
into structures infested with the aberrations; however, no 
one has yet deciphered their meaning
salvage
Alchemists given the carcasses of at least ten worms, and 
200 gp worth of alchemical regents, can craft a 
potion of 
mind reading.
 This task requires 8 hours and a successful 
DC 13 Intelligence check using alchemist’s tools.

DC 10 Intelligence (Arcane)
: Individually, the worms 
are intelligent, but they gain genius-level intellect when 
gathered in a swarm. 
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcane)
: The bites of the creatures 
can briefly poison victims. Swarms of these creatures can 
psionically cast powerful magics that affect the mind.

DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 The downcast were once 
immortal celestial servants to the gods. Each has inclinations 
and aptitudes based on the god they once served.
DC 13 Intelligence (Religion):
 As a result of their 
divine nature, fallen though it might be, downcast have 
resistance to necrotic damage and limited access to 
innate magic.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The physical form of a 
downcast contains significant power from before their 
fallen state. A ritual requiring the sacrifice or corpse of a 
downcast can draw out this power.

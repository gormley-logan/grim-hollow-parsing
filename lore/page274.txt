Quake Drake
“Sometimes I still feel the rumble, 
always right before I fall asleep.”
Protective Breed
. Ancient arcanists once bred dragon-
like creatures to protect their isolated homes. As often 
happens when arcanists interfere with the natural world, 
these drakes turned on their masters, destroyed their 
homes, stole their treasures, and buried themselves 
beneath the earth.
Affinity for the Earth
. These drakes, suffused with 
the magic from their creators, found that they could hold 
sway over the tremors and power of the very mountains 
in which they took residence. When an unexpected tremor 
moves the ground, people of mountain villages say that 
two quake drakes are either warring or mating.

The quake drake has a thick hide of scales that can 
be worked into 
quakescale armor
 (see Chapter 4). A 
proficient armorer can spend 30 hours and 300 gp of 
components to make this armor, and then must succeed 
on a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check.
Additionally, a quake drake has a 50% chance of 
having a particular precious metal or gem resting in 
its belly. Any coin amount represents an approximate 
value, since the metal is now compressed into a ball:

lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History)
: Quake drakes are 
the bane of precious metal or gem mines, or caravans 
carrying such things. More than one mine has been 
obliterated and collapsed by a quake drake.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature)
: Be wary of collections 
of sand or rock spheres you find, that’s from a quake 
drake belly.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
: The quake drake is 
suffused with magic that shakes the earth and can stun 
a person with its tail attack.
GM Advice:
 A single or pair of quake drakes would make a 
significant challenge for a lower-level party trying to remove the 
beasts from an old mine that they’re using as a lair. Not only are 
the creatures themselves a threat, but the very setting itself could 
prove dangerous. Imagine dealing with the drakes and some other 
creatures dwelling in the area, while at the same time having to 
use skills in nature, engineering, and other fields to keep the entire 
place from crashing down on their heads.
The key to making such an adventure tense and fun while still 
being manageable and fair is to ramp up the tension first. As 
the characters move into the lair, describe some cave-ins and 
rumblings. Then have the characters experience a slightly 
dangerous passage where Perception and Investigation checks can 
avoid the damage. At the end, and maybe even during a battle, the 
characters must reinforce supports or rock formations that are the 
only things holding up the ceiling.

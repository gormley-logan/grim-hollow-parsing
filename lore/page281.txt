Raven of Ill Omen
“Ravens can be a sign of bad tidings, but their 
monarchs bring mischief and upheaval.”
Raven “Rulers.” 
Ravens of ill omen are larger than 
normal ravens. A plume of feathers, red and white, and 
alabaster eyes set it further apart from its kin. These regal

schemes through mimicry and other tricks.

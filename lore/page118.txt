Faevlin
“Never make a deal with the fey. Never make a deal with a 
goblin. And if you ever meet a faevlin, you’ll know why.”
Fey Goblin.
 Faevlins are what happen when a group of 
goblins makes deals with the fey that they can’t keep. In poor 
lighting, a faevlin can be mistaken for a goblin. However, 
faevlins are unmistakable in the light. They have teal skin, 
and a faevlin’s head is upside down. Faevlins work for 
stronger fey or guard places where the veil between the 
mortal world and the land of fairies is weak.
Broken Promises.
 As the story goes, in ancient times, 
a clan of goblins made a deal with a fey lady to gain 
power. The goblins thought they could break the rules 
of the deal if no fey were watching. They were wrong. 
Fey magic swept the clan away. When they returned, 
they were faevlins.  Some say these faevlins escaped, and 
others claim the fey sent them back to the mortal world 
to cause trouble. Still others say their servitude ended 
because they were more trouble than they were worth.
Uncharmed Life.
 Faevlins willingly work with other 
creatures, often for mischief and crime, and can be bullied 
by stronger, wicked beings. They can’t be charmed by 
creatures other than fey. But a faevlin might pretend to be 
charmed to get the drop on an enemy.
salvage
Faevlins love to collect objects that increase their 
personal prestige and power. Every faevlin is likely 
to have a few personal trinkets like this, along with the 
occasional item of real worth.

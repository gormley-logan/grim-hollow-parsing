Lenchtahg
“The smoky, fiery form hisses and shrieks 
in a cacophony of anger and confusion. 
There’s something almost holy in the sound.”
Corrupted Seraphs.
 Arch Daemon Malikir, corrupter 
of all that is good, crafted the first lenchtahg from the 
seraphic body of a captured member of Arch Seraph 
Empyreus’s court. Taking glee in twisting a follower 
of the so-called “Unbroken Seraph,” the Arch Daemon 
killed the Seraph, distorted its spirit, and transformed it 
into a construct of smoke and flame, a being in constant 
agony, compelled to obey its demonic overlords.

Blood Brood
“If you spot small, spiny orbs of blood flying around, beware 
their mum, who’ll be on the ground but not far behind.”
Shared Blood.
 The blood brooder gets its name from 
the fact that it looks like an armored, spined collection of 
blood and viscera, and it births smaller orbs called blood 
bulbs. These offspring are less armored but as sapient 
and predatory as their parent. With malign guile, these 
aberrations hunt for other creatures and devour them. 
Members of this brood protect one another not only by 
coordinating to defeat foes, but also by exchanging the 
fluid that makes up their bodies.
Roaming Family.
 While the brooder rests and births, 
blood bulbs roam, searching for more prey. They split 
into packs to hunt, and then report back to their kin. 
When on the move, the brooder often carries bulbs in 
pouches on its sides.

Someone who has proficiency with leatherworker’s tools 
can use the hide and spines of a blood brooder to fashion

and other materials worth 50 gp.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Members of the blood 
brood are oozelike aberrations. They aren’t as fluid as 
oozes, but they can’t be knocked prone.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Blood bulbs, which are 
thought to be infant blood brooders, can attach to prey 
and engulf the head. They can also hide in pouches on 
the side of a blood brooder.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The blood brood can 
exchange blood when close, each supporting the survival 
of others.

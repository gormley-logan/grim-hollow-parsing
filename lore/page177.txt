salvage
Brave sailors hunt keppmirs for their horns. Someone 
who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies can use 
one horn combined with other reagents, including 
dried seaweed from the Sea of Turmoil, to create a 
potion of glacial resistance
 (see chapter 4). Creating the 
potion requires 4 hours of work and a successful DC 13 
Intelligence (Arcana) check.
The ancient 
Crown of the Keppmir King
 (see chapter 4) 
has never been removed from his massive horns. Anyone 
who could defeat the leader could claim this prize.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 The story of the 
Keppmir clan is known to many.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 A keppmir has a heated 
body, which provides them with some resistance to the 
cold. Although they attack ships and coastal settlements, 
they can’t breathe air.
GM Advice:
 Because of their need to breathe water, 
keppmir are less of a threat on land. If you want to make 
them a larger threat, make them amphibious instead. 
Additionally, if they ever gained access to magic that allowed 
them to breathe air, this could pose the same threat.
Providing weapons that can also grapple on a successful 
attack, like some form of barbed spear, would allow 
keppmir to not only do extra fire damage, but also hold 
enemies underwater and provide a drowning risk.

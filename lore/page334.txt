Tangle Weed
“Tangle weed, tangle weed, grows in the lake.
Tangle weed, tangle weed, your neck will break. 
Tangle weed, tangle weed, pulls you down.
Tangle weed, tangle weed, you will drown.”
-children’s nursery rhyme
Hiding in Plain Sight
. Tangle weeds grow in 
stagnant lakes and slow-moving rivers amidst other 
plants and algae. The long, feathery strands are difficult 
to differentiate from less dangerous lake plants.
Drowning Danger
. While tangle weed constricts its 
prey, the real danger is the environment. Tangle weed 
drags its prey underwater where drowning is possible.
Whipping Strands
. Pulling a victim free of the tangle 
weed is harder than it looks. The plant makes attacks 
against any creature pushed, pulled, or shoved out of its 
grasp, often grabbing the victim again before allies move 
them clear.
salvage
The strands of a tangle weed can be gathered and com-
bined with 25 gp of components to create a 
potion of 
growth
. This requires a proficient arcanist to succeed on a 
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check after 4 hours of work.

them again.

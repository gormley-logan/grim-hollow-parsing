Fzeg
“We’ve been led to believe that vampires and werewolves are 
natural enemies. Convenient that two fearsome creatures 
would be so opposed to the other. Never did we imagine, nor 
prepare, for a time when they might unite.”
Horrific Hybrid
. A fzeg is a fusion of a vampire and 
werewolf. The hybrid possesses a combination of abilities 
more powerful than either. Unlike vampires, fzegs can 
enter any residence without invitation, and they are 
undeterred by running water or sunlight. A fzeg’s howl 
can shake the resolve of a seasoned monster hunter.
Sly Shapechanger
. To blend in and gain the trust of 
its prey, a fzeg disguises itself as a humanoid. When a 
kill is imminent, though, a fzeg moves with great speed 
to feed its insatiable bloodlust.
Cursed Spawn
. A fzeg’s bite stuns some foes and 
curses others. Death might seem a welcome option. 
But the power of the fzeg is such that a victim who dies 
by its bite might arise as its spawn the next night.

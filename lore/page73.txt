Crawling Grave
“This thing was born from a mass grave? 
Makes you wonder who the real monster is, doesn’t it?”
Undead Victims. 
Unspeakable violence leads to the 
creation of mass graves, where the dead lie lost and 
forgotten. The energy from this cruelty can coalesce 
into tangles of bones that rise to seek out and add new 
skeletons to the hideous mass.
Undead Nature.
A crawling grave doesn’t require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can use powdered bones from a destroyed crawling grave 
to brew a death-defying potion. If a creature drinks the 
potion, the first time they would drop to 0 hit points 
within 8 hours after drinking they instead drop to 1 hit 
point. Brewing the potion takes 2 days and materials 
worth 50 gp, and brewing it correctly requires a successful 
DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check. One crawling grave 
has enough bones to refine into four doses of this potion.

A leeching willow is potent and powerful while inside 
of its protective tree form, but when severed from it 
and extracted, it’s as weak and feeble as newborn lamb. 
The greatest treasure one can get from the aberration 
is the incredible font of knowledge it possesses about 
humanoids it has fed from. 
A book made from the pulp of the tree containing 
the aberration can be made into a 
tome of clear thought
. 
This process requires a successful DC 20 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check from a proficient bookmaker or sage, as 
well as 5000 gp of ink and other rare components used 
over 15 days.
lore
DC 10 Wisdom (Perception)
: The air around you is 
sweet and delectable, it feels fresh as if you were high 
on a mountain. It’s not a fragrance you recognize, and it 
doesn’t smell like any food you have experience before, 
but it smells delicious all the same.
DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine)
: The villager you see looks 
sickly and tired, as if they haven’t got a good night’s rest 
in over a week. Their muscles have deteriorated from 
lack of use, and they show no motivation for life or work.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
: The spores in the air are 
magical in nature, and they give a psychic connection 
between those infected by the spores and the tree that 
emits the spores.

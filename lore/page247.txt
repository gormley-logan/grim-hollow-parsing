DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Outlaws rely on speed 
and a decisive first strike to demoralize their quarry. 
Those in this profession often love a flamboyant lifestyle 
and the thrill of riding into danger.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 Outlaws prefer to use 
blackpowder pistols for an initial strike. The powerful 
attack and the loud noise strengthen the impact of the 
outlaw’s arrival, causing many to give up without a 
further fight.
GM Advice:
 Hit and run tactics are a mainstay of outlaw tactics. 
Any outlaw worth their weight in blackpowder always has a 
contingency plan for when circumstances don’t favor them. 
Using mounts means they can escape more easily, and often the 
paths they take while escaping are lined with traps that they can 
easily avoid, while pursuers must contend with them.

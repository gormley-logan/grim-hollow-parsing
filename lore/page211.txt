Maskenmagier
“A mask can hide who you are. 
Careful lest you forget who you are.”
Feline Fiend.
 The maskenmagier can alter its appearance 
to take any humanoid form, but it is a cat-headed fiend 
with a humanoid body. Driven by a desire to grow 
more powerful, the maskenmagier makes masks and 
consumes souls.
Magical Masks.
 Carved from wood and painted with 
natural pigments on a neutral base of glue and crushed 
seashell, the masks a maskenmagier offers portray a 
beast. Each mask allows the wearer to transform into 
that animal.
A maskenmagier is a clever spellcaster artful at 
negotiation and hungry for power. It offers people the 
opportunity to escape life’s troubles through mask 
magic. A deal consists of a proposal that covers the 
terms each party expects. Accepting the mask seals the 
agreement and makes the contract binding.

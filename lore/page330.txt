Svangras
“In a world fraught with danger, sometimes 
even the underfoot flora is deadly.”
Cursed Grass.
 Stories claim that imps plant svangras, 
but it really grows in places where travelers died, 
particularly from exhaustion. Svangras is a bulb plant 
that looks like a large onion that can move on small 
tendrils. When svangras forms, grass in its area falls 
under its control. Anyone walking on svangras is said 
to be doomed to unending exhaustion.

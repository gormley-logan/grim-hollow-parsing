Cauchemange
“We thought he was just having nightmares for a few 
days straight, until he keeled over in the field and a big 
worm burrowed from his chest.”
Failed Experiment.
 Folktales say the Arch Daemon 
Beleth created the cauchemange as another tool to torment 
mortals. Those who’ve studied the secret histories of the 
Arcanist Inquisition know that these aberrations are a result 
of a failed experiment by a long-dead Ostoyan wizard. Her 
intent was to create a creature that allows command over 
armies of mind-controlled servants. Instead, the experiment 
created a creature that feeds on and manipulates 
people’s nightmares.
Hungry Larvae.
 A larval cauchemange resembles a 
monstrous maggot the size of a human forearm. Hardy, 
magically resistant creatures, these larvae seek host bodies 
to burrow into and continue their life cycle. Cauchemange 
larvae prefer sleeping victims, an insidious trait, because 
the entry wound heals rapidly, and a victim recognizes 
few signs of an invading parasite.
Nightmare Pupation.
 Once a cauchemange larva 
burrows into a creature, the larva’s body dissolves into tiny 
particles that distribute themselves into the host’s nervous 
system. As the cauchemange pupates, it induces nightmares, 
hallucinations, and terrifying thoughts, which it feeds upon to 
mature. While an infected adult is likely to have an extremely 
uncomfortable few days, many such victims are thought 
to suffer from lesser maladies.
Dream Incarnate.
 Once a cauchemange absorbs enough 
negative memories, thoughts, and dreams, it bursts out of the 
host’s body, taking the form of the host’s worst nightmare. 
This corporeal cauchemange is a nightmare made flesh. 
It can take a variety of forms, depending on the host’s fears 
or lusts. From a potent host or after developing for years, 
an adult cauchemange can become a ghostly creature that 
shifts among nightmare forms.

Tachna
“Works of art can truly captivate with their 
physical and emotional beauty. Sometimes the trick 
becomes freeing yourself from this captivity.”
Warped Works
. Tachnae are created when powerful 
aberrations manifest in proximity to (or create) works 
of art. Chaotic energy from the Aether Kindred mutates 
the artwork, giving them sentience and malicious 
appetites. This most often affects paintings, frescos, 
mosaics, and tapestries.
Captivating Content
. Tachnae feed upon creatures 
who gaze upon or touch them. Victims of tachna attacks 
may notice subtle changes in the surface of the artwork’s 
medium and abnormalities in the subject content. For 
example, a summer landscape may show signs of rot 
spreading through the greenery, portrait faces twist into 
wicked, baleful grins, and buildings crumble or walls 
begin to bleed.
Macabre Endings
.
Creatures killed by a tachna are 
depicted as hidden details within the work of art.
Garish Galleries
.
Powerful bursts of energy from the 
prison realm of the Aether Kindred can corrupt nearby 
galleries or museums. If left unchecked, these sentient 
demiplanes spread, threatening entire communities.

When the tachna is defeated, the chaotic energy that 
cause the mutation is driven from the creature, making 
it a normal work of art. These works of art often fetch 
twice their normal prices by collectors who revel in 
the knowledge that the work has been touched by 
otherworldly forces.

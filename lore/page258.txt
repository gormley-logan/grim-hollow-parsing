Plague Doctor
“Those who hold power over life and death are 
dangerous for exactly that reason.”
Medical Calling.
 When the Weeping Pox spread in 
Liesech, the call went out for any mage or physician who 
might be able to develop a cure for this horrible blight. 
This call led to an influx of healers and wizards, many 
hoping to gain fame and glory by solving the riddle of 
this new disease. They were unprepared for the situation 
that awaited them.
Forged by Disaster.
 Liesech was in a horrible state. 
The disease swept from person to person unhindered 
by treatments that science and magic could bring to 
bear. In desperation, the few healers who managed to 
avoid succumbing to the disease developed entirely new 
branches of magical alchemy in hopes of stemming the tide.
Two groups emerged from this plague-ridden 
metropolis. One is the Morbus Doctore, who claimed 
victory over the disease with a secretive and costly cure. 
The other is an ununified host of would-be saviors, some 
twisted by the horrors they witnessed.

Plague doctors are experts at medicinal arts and possess 
alchemist’s supplies, healer’s kits, and herbalism kits. 
Once they progress into the more specialized alchemy, 
they might also have several concoctions, including 
many potions that mimic spells. See the Plague Doctor 
wizard tradition in chapter 5 of 
Grim Hollow: The Players 
Guide
 for more information on what a plague doctor 
might have or how these NPCs might be customized.

DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 In the wake of the 
Weeping Pox, many mages and scholars delved into 
the study of diseases. Those who learned the secrets of 
blending science and magic into alchemical concoctions 
are known as plague doctors.

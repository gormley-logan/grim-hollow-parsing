Mud Zombie
“Never go into a fight with a mud zombie alone. 
It’s full of surprises you won’t enjoy.”
Fused Gore.
 Any muddy or swampy area could hide 
a grotesque surprise. Mud zombies form from piles of 
gore. At rest, they look like mounds of remains, but 
when roused, each becomes a writhing mass of muck-
covered limbs. These limbs can split from the mass and 
continue fighting.
Undead Nature.
A mud zombie doesn’t require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.
salvage
Mud zombies often contain or still wear equipment and 
jewelry left on the zombie’s constituent parts.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Mud zombies look like 
large piles of gore.
DC 13 Intelligence (Religion):
 Stories tell of 
these writhing masses breaking into smaller 
monsters when attacked.
GM Advice:
 For some added fun and challenge, add a ranged 
attack for the mud zombie, where it throws grasping hands at 
enemies. These hands attack at +5, doing 6 (1d6 + 3) damage 
on a successful attack. A hand continues to claw at the targeted 
creature for that damage each round until the target escapes 
the claw (escape DC 13).

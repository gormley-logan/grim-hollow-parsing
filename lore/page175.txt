Many collectors of bizarre objects prize the fossils 
that make up a jespaith’s skeleton, and poisoners and 
alchemists covet them for deadlier purposes. Grinding 
jespaith bones and adding them to poison increases 
the poison’s saving throw DC by 1. One jespaith can 
produce 10 doses of such powder. Two doses can affect 
one poison with a cumulative DC increase, but further 
additions of the powder have no further effect.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana)
: The jespaith is immune 
to acid, necrotic, and poison damage but vulnerable to 
radiant damage.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature)
: The jespaith turns the 
ground around it into broken shards and upturned earth, 
making the monster easy to track.
DC 20 Intelligence (History)
: Not only can the jespaith 
spit a caustic stream of poison, but it can also grab and 
engulf creatures within its mass, crushing them with its 
strange, rocky skeleton and dissolving their flesh with acid.

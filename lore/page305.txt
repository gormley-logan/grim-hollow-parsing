Shrieking Mandrake
“The farmer sighed as he saw yet another corpse in his 
mandrake field. Would foolish thieves never learn?”
Lethal Deterrent.
 Some enterprising farmers grow 
ordinary mandrakes, valuable to alchemists and mages. 
Shrieking mandrakes usually grow in the wild, but they 
can be cultivated to protect a crop of normal mandrakes. 
When a shrieking mandrake is plucked from the ground, 
it releases a deadly sound.
salvage
When casting a spell that deals psychic damage, a spell-
caster can include powder from one shrieking mandrake. 
The spell consumes the powder, but the caster can roll 
one extra damage die, then eliminate the lowest die 
before calculating the damage.

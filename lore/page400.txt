Laneshi Vampire
“The creature’s flesh was loose and wrinkled, like he had soaked 
too long. His hair was tangled, matted with seaweed and sand. He 
had a wild look, and he made a slurping sound as he charged in.”
Cursed Waters
. The Llana’Shi Empire is no stranger to 
the dark tales of vampires. Vampirism has been among 
laneshi for ages, despite the protection of the sea. With 
more laneshi visiting lands above the waves, the curse 
has spread further. Old legends among laneshi speak 
of warriors falling under the curse for misdeeds, or 
of mystics transformed due to missteps or intentional 
arcane experiments
Blood Drinkers.
 More than other vampires, laneshi 
vampires prefer to drink their sustenance. Their feed-
ing method leaves victims who survive parched. 
This connection to water gives a laneshi vampire some 
benefits. Running water never bothers laneshi vampires, 
and holy water is less effective against them. The 
downside to these advantages is that laneshi vampires 
can’t survive without immersion in water.
salvage
Someone who consumes part of a laneshi vampire can 
breathe water for 1 hour, in addition to other benefits 
and drawbacks.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Laneshi vampires prefer 
to drink their sustenance and can rarely resist consuming 
blood if they see or smell it.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Vampirism makes 
laneshi agile fighters who move easily in and out of 
combat. They retain water-related advantages, including 
not only swimming, but also no weakness to running 
water other vampires have and a resistance to holy 
water. A laneshi’s bite leaves a victim parched.
DC 20 Intelligence (Religion):
 A laneshi vampire can 
die if unable to immerse in water or feed. The vampire’s 
body disintegrates if it dies in this way.

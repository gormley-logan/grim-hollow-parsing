The Angel of Empyreus wields a 
holy avenger
. Upon its 
death, its intelligence inhabits the sword. To attune to 
it, a paladin character must agree to carry on the angel’s 
mission to cleanse the land of immorality.
A cup of its blood can be made into a 
potion of supreme 
healing
 with a DC 10 Intelligence (Religion) check from 
someone proficient with alchemist’s supplies. Six cups of 
blood can be taken from the Angel of Empyreus.
Its bones can be used in place of diamonds for use 
in 
raise dead
 and similar magic, up to the equivalent of 
10,000 gp worth.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion)
: The Arch Seraphs are 
attended by mighty angels who act as their lieutenants 
and execute the divine remnants’ orders.
DC 15 Intelligence (History)
: Empyreus went into 
battle surrounded by an honor guard of fearsome 
celestials honed by aeons of divine war. Many of them 
remained at Empyreus’ side at the end of the Four 
Divines’ War, but not all remained loyal.
DC 20 Intelligence (History)
: Peasant revolts and reli-
gious zealotry are on the rise in the Altenheim hinterland. 
Most say it’s the usual grievances, but some whisper that 
a commander of the celestial hosts leads the revolt, and 
its ranks swell by the day.

Catacomb Haunt
“Don’t be distracted by the bones and skulls set into the walls. 
It’s what comes through the walls that can kill you.”
Necropolis Guardians.
 Many creatures and cultures 
revere the dead. Those with the ambition and the know-
how even build catacombs or necropolises to house the 
bones of those who have passed before. Many of those 
dead rest peacefully, but the spirits of some remain 
behind to keep the living out. Among these undead are 
catacomb haunts.
Incorporeal Skirmishers.
 Catacomb haunts prefer 
the tight, cramped quarters of a necropolis, where 
winding passages can disorient intruders. The haunts 
have no such disadvantage. They pop through walls to 
attack before retreating the way they came.
Elemental Weakness.
 A catacomb haunt has a 
weakness to one element, often based on the region in 
which it dwells or the nature of its death. Something 
about a haunt reveals this weakness, such as tiny sparks 
in its form for fire or a subtle crackling mist for cold. This 
element can be exploited to force the haunt to become 
corporeal temporarily. Haunts who lurk in the same 
catacombs often share a weakness.
salvage
The bizarre ectoplasm a catacomb haunt leaves behind 
fluctuates between material and immaterial states. 
The ectoplasm from one haunt can be preserved in a 
sealed container. Applied to one weapon or 10 pieces 
of ammunition in 1 minute, the ectoplasm makes those 
coated weapons magical for 1 hour.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 This creature is a 
restless spirit called a catacomb haunt. It should have 
one weakness to a specific element among acid, cold, fire, 
lightning, or thunder. Exploiting this weakness turns the 
spirit corporeal temporarily.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 One can learn a catacomb 
haunt’s weakness by looking for clues in its shadowy form.

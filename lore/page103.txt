Eater of Orbs
“With a fiendish grin, the urchin pops the merchant’s eye 
into his mouth, and then transforms into the dead man.”
Servants to Warlocks
. Some warlocks ritualistically 
infuse their followers with demonic humors to give the 
underlings fiendish power. Those who survive become 
operatives with extraordinary abilities. Some of the most 
powerful of these subjects become eaters of orbs.
Working backward from the conclusion that the eyes 
are windows to the soul, eaters of orbs are trained to 
extract the essence of a being through the consumption 
of their eyes. With this abominable exchange, an eater of 
orbs trained in stealth, impersonation, and assassination 
can become a top-notch agent and spy.
Fiendish Infiltrators
. An eater of orbs is unlikely 
to engage in direct violence unless they have their 
victim in a position to kill them outright and take their 
identity. After taking an identity, the eater impersonates 
the victim as long as needed, taking advantage of 
opportunities the charade grants. The eater avoids 
confrontation while disguised, sending allies or minions 
to deal with threats. When cornered, however, an eater 
of orbs doesn’t hesitate to fight.

A spellcaster that has at least one 3rd-level spell slot can 
fashion the scalp of an eater of orbs that has eaten an 
eye within the last 24 hours into a hat of disguise. This 
process takes 8 hours, materials worth 100 gp, and a 
successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

Xakalonus
“The Stillborn Forest crawls with these beasts, and their 
howls foretell even larger monsters approaching.”
Spawn of the Hraptnon.
 The legendary monster 
known as the hraptnon holds sway in the Stillborn 
Forest, protecting its hidden heart at a central glade. 
Xakalonus are spawn of this monstrosity, coming into 
being when blood spurts from that monster’s wounds. 
Unlike their progenitor, xakalonus can leave the Stillborn 
Forest, and they now threaten the lands that border the 
dangerous place.
Driven Away, Called Home.
 When their creator, 
the hraptnon, is in danger, the xakalonus in its vicinity 
rush to its defense. When all threats are gone, however, 
the creatures have the innate urge to wander far and 
wide. Their goal is to devour the brains of magic-using 
creatures. Once they do this, they instinctively return 
to the hraptnon, disgorge the brains for the hraptnon to 
consume to maintain its horrible existence, and then they 
wander off again.
salvage
A xakalonus brain is encased in a viscous jelly which can 
be turned into a substance called 
arcane oil
 (see Chapter 
4). This oil’s creation requires a proficient alchemist to 
spend 8 hours and 200 gp of components. They must 
succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check to create 
the substance.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 Xakalonus are created 
from wounds to the hraptnon. These creatures, though 
always originating in the Stillborn Forest, can be found 
anywhere in Etharis. They feed on the brains of creatures 
that use magic, then return to offer up the brain to the 
hraptnon.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 If magic effects but does 
not harm a xakalonus, the magic might heal them or 
power their attacks instead.

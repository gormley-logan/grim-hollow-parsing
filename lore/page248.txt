Pactbreaker
“If the daemons seek to influence mortals by these 
blasphemous bargains, we’ll see to it their pawns 
know the price of their dealings.”
Chaotic Constructs.
 Pactbreakers are constructs 
that seek out and punish those who enter bargains with 
otherworldly entities. Each is crafted in a distorted image 
of a warrior, angel, or another representation of justice.
Celestial Weapons. 
Followers of Solyma, the Arch 
Seraph of Justice, crafted the first pactbreakers. Bereft 
of her guidance, members of this sect decided to take 
vengeance on those who treat with fiends, evil fey 
and Aether Kindred. They forged pactbreakers to 
enforce their holy laws, using celestial magic and forces 
drawn from elemental chaos. This magic grants each 
pactbreaker the ability to alter its attacks.

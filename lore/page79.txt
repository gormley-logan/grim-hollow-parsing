Dark Mist Stalker
“As we made camp the mist rolled in. Lassiter screamed, but 
we didn’t see anything. Then another scream. And an arrow. 
Then another. No twang of a bow, just the sharp sound of 
impact. A full retreat was ordered and we all ran for our lives. 
At least the three of us who weren’t dead.”
Trespassers Beware
. In places where the fey courts 
claim dominance in the mortal world, guards were placed 
to keep out trespassers. Then the Mists came. The noble 
fey guards were turned into dark versions of their past 
selves. They no longer serve their fey patrons—instead, 
they kill any interlopers.

The hunting bows of the dark mist stalkers are renowned 
for their accuracy and ranges so much so that foolish 
adventurers and hunters of all skill levels attempt to 
recover them. A slain dark mist stalker has a 10% chance 
to be carrying a weapon that can be turned into an 
oathbow.
 Such a weapon can be altered by a proficient 
weaponsmith, who must succeed on a DC 25 Intelligence 
(Arcana) check after spending 10 days and 7500 gp 
of components.

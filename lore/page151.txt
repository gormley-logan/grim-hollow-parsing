Hedron
“It was surreal and beautiful, like a painting. A forest of 
perfectly spaced, identical trees, a circular lake, and ground as 
smooth and even as a road. Floating in the middle was a cube, 
polished to a mirror finish.”
Order Incarnate.
 Hedrons are elementals of pure 
order. They see the world as a chaotic place that must be 
tamed. This view puts them at odds with reality.
Forced Conformity.
 As the purified essence of order, 
a hedron wants to impose perfection on its surroundings. 
Terrain smooths, objects refine, and animals warp into 
identical copies. This process is painful, often lethal, 
to creatures.
Amoral Imperative.
 Hedrons are sapient beings, rigid 
in their terraforming efforts. The well-being of other entities 
is of no consequence to a hedron. An orderly corpse is just 
as good as a living clone.
Elemental Nature.
 A hedron doesn’t require air, food, 
drink, or sleep.

The matter composing a hedron resolves into perfect 
geometric solids when the elemental collapses. These 
polyhedrons can be used to make fifty dice that land on 
a number the roller wants, provided the roller knows 
the dice work this way. These dice are worth 5 to 10 gp 
each to the right buyers.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History): 
A hedron is an 
elemental aligned with law rather than traditional 
elements. It can manipulate and harm creatures 
and objects with invisible force.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Hedrons exude an 
aura that transforms creatures and objects into “orderly” 
forms. For creatures, the body resists, and the process is 
painful and potentially lethal.

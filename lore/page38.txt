Bloodwood Giants
“There was little we could do. Even Miklas’s healing 
light couldn’t staunch the blood welling from the 
wound torn by the giant’s spear.”
Masters of Forest Depths
. Tainted by evil, these 
giants guard well their dark forested homes. Their dark 
mottled skin blends easily into the dappled light of 
shadowy woods.
Vicious Hunters
. The giants live in small clans, usually 
led by their strongest warrior. They wield great spears 
roughly carved from bloodwood trees that tear ragged 
wounds which even skilled healers have trouble mending.
Ancient Bargains
. These giants pay reverence to dark, 
long-forgotten spirits. Their shamans the vine callers, 
make blood-filled promises to ancient entities, hoping to 
reclaim lands they believe were stolen from them.
Cunning Giants. 
Though not as strong as their giant 
cousins, bloodwood giants are far more cunning. Experts 
at woodcraft, they can evade all but the most skilled 
trackers in their woodland homes.
Vine Caller
. Vine callers use ancient magic to conjure 
dark vines from the earth, stealing vitality from their victims. 
Though they rarely lead clans, no giant dares dispute their 
words for fear of the dark magic at their disposal.
Chieftan
. Most chieftains earn the grudging respect of 
their tribe by being their greatest hunter. Vine callers often 
tutor promising youth they foresee becoming clan leaders.
salvage
The massive bloodwood spears used by these giants 
are too large to be effectively wielded by Medium or 
smaller creatures.
However, individuals proficient in carpenter’s tools 
who succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Nature) check can 
reduce the size of the giant’s spear to the equivalent of 
a pike (1d10 piercing damage) and which inflicts the 
bleeding condition if targets fail a DC 12 Constitution 
saving throw (see 
Grim Hollow Campaign Guide
).

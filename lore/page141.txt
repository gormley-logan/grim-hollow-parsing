Grinstagger
“Of course, people survived! If no one survived, there 
wouldn’t be stories, now would there? Unless he’s 
spreading them himself...”
Nightmare Incarnate.
 Grinstagger is a mighty oni 
known throughout Etharis for his cruelty and unique 
appearance. One side of his body is rigid and plantlike, 
giving him a perpetual grin and a staggering gait. Hence 
his name. Oni are the subject of numerous tales and 
frightful children’s rhymes, but Grinstagger is known 
and feared even among his kind.
Unchecked Ambition.
 Grinstagger entered a pact 
with a fey queen in exchange for more arcane power. 
He never intended to become a slave to another, 
however. Using ancient magic, Grinstagger wrested 
control of his pact away from his patron. Enraged, she 
sent numerous servants to hunt down the rogue 
warlock, but he eluded or slew each one.
Twisted Punishment.
 Unable to subdue Grinstagger, 
the fey queen cursed the oni. With each use of his power, 
Grinstagger’s flesh hardened into a woody substance. 
His face locked in a rictus and his right side stiffened, 
giving him a limp. But this punishment did little to deter 
Grinstagger, who redirected the curse, freeing himself 
from its continuing effects before slipping from his 
former patron’s clutches.

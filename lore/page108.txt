Empyrean 
Brazen Bull
“The smell of smoke and incense consumed the castle walls, and 
we heard the furious and gleeful bellows of the most immense 
bull we’d ever seen. As our battlements burned and crumbled, 
we knew all was lost.”
The Golden Bull.
 This golden metallic bull is filled 
with divine fire. A nimbus of soul fire dances around it, 
emanating from its glowing and intelligent amber eyes, 
and flaming hoof tracks follow in its wake.
Beast with a Burden. 
The stomachs of this 
divine bovine are full of soulfire, and all that it eats 
is consumed in its heavenly absolution. A soul of 
pure celestial energy inhabits its divine and golden 
metal trappings. It delights in the cleansing of evil, 
steadfast in its purpose, and stubborn in its execution 
of its duty.
‘Mooving’ and Shaking.
 The brazen bull was used 
by the celestial armies as a formation breaker and siege 
engine. It can charge through the enemy, break down 
fortresses, and, if it is felled in battle, take more than a 
few opponents as the fire in its belly explodes.

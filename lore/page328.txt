Sunwraith
“An eclipse can drive the superstitious to 
extremes. But imagine an eclipse charging at you 
with murderous intent. That’s a sunwraith.”
Corrupted Celestials.
 Powerful fiendish or undead 
beings seek ways to harness and pervert celestial power. 
Sunwraiths result when such creatures succeed in corrupt-
ing a mighty celestial and stripping it of its sense of self.
Living Eclipse.
 Sunwraiths are luminous, vaguely 
humanoid beings of white light with a golden halo. 
When the pious approach, the sunwraith reveals its 
shadowy form, like that of an eclipse, with a luminous 
or prismatic corona.
salvage
When a sunwraith dies, it disintegrates, leaving behind a 
golden gem shot through with obsidian veins. This jewel 
is a 
gem of brightness
 with 2d10 charges. The jewel can be 
thrown up to 60 feet, where it is destroyed as it releases 
a 
flame strike
 (save DC 15) that has a 50% chance to deal 
necrotic damage rather than radiant, and it deals 1 extra 
damage of that type per charge the gem had remaining.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 Celestials can 
be corrupted, and a sunwraith is a product of one 
corrupting process. When the corrupt celestial kills, it 
can subjugate the victim’s spirit.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Sunwraiths are resistant 
to necrotic and radiant damage, and they deal that damage. 
Magic weapons are most effective against this monster.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A sunwraith’s corona 
flashes when someone who isn’t next to the sunwraith 
harms it. This flash can be blinding.

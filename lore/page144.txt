Grotesquerie
“A rotten stump, surrounded by a swarm of 
chittering woodland creatures, sprouts a maw.  
The animals hurl themselves into the orifice.”
Stationary Predators
. A being such as a treant, 
awakened tree, or dryad can become infected in an 
encounter with an aberration. Over weeks of painful 
mutation, what remains is an enormous, slimy tree 
stump with clouded eyes and a gaping maw. A 
grotesquerie is no longer a part of its ecosystem but 
a canker on the landscape. It can move but rarely 
chooses to do so when not in combat.
Woodland Minions.
 A grotesquerie suborns the 
will of weak-minded woodland creatures. They kill 
and bring back the carcasses of the higher life forms 
the grotesquerie craves for sustenance. 
Vile Hunger.
 Regardless of how many minions it takes 
to get the job done, a grotesquerie summons more and 
more until its hunger is temporarily sated. Grotesqueries 
are capable of swallowing human-sized creatures whole, 
and it slowly digests any kind of material. Given time, 
the stones in its gizzard pulverize flesh, bone, and metal.

The gizzard-stones of a dead grotesquerie are 
diamond-hard and may be used or sold as diamonds 
with an equivalent worth of 250 gp in spells or 
alchemical experiments.

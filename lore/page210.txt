Marra
“Marras are literally the stuff of nightmares.”
Nightmare Spirits
. These nocturnal visitors sit on a 
sleeping victim’s chest, drawing out personal fears and 
driving poor souls to panic before suffocating them. 
Those who have survived a marra attack testified that 
when the creature came to visit, the victim felt a heavy 
weight on their chest before losing the ability to move.
Survivor accounts also report the marra can shapechange, 
often becoming moths. In this form, a marra can enter rooms 
through keyholes or other tiny openings.
Night Riders
. Marra steal horses and other mounts, riding 
off into the twilight in search of victims. The animals are 
left exhausted and covered in sweat by dawn.
salvage
A nightmare pine grows in the marra’s wake. A proficient 
woodcarver’s tools can fashion a 
nightmare staff
 (see 
Chapter 4) from this stunted tree. Doing so takes 5 days 
of work, materials worth 100 gp, and someone to cast 
phantasmal force
 on the staff each day.
Near where a marra is slain, there is a 50% chance of 
finding an adder stone (see Chapter 4).

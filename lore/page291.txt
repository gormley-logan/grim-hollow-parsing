to the Stál clan and was one of the most powerful 
warriors who ever walked the North. Her axe, 
Coldrazor
, 
is almost as legendary as she is.

 Folklore says that, 
because of her cruel slaughtering of her kin, Runa 
sacrificed her shapechanging ability and instead channels 
death and fiery rage. In fact, her form is unchangeable.

The reaction of most folks who have encountered a hor-
ror flit is, “Burn it with fire!” But a handful of naturalists 
seek out these creatures for a variety of purposes, paying 
handsomely for samples. Bounties for these creatures in 
urban areas range from 10 to 100 gp.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 A horror flit has no 
eyes, but they sense their prey by means of vibrations in 
the air or in the water. They breed by infesting the flesh 
of their prey.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The largest of these 
creatures, called “breeders” by most, can spit out swarms 
of their young, especially when the breeder instinctively 
feels it might die. The creature normally reproduces 
more slowly, vomiting a new swarm every few days.

Angel of Empyreus
“I am that which can cleanse temptation from the 
land and restore it once more to divinity. What a weak 
creature of flesh you are, blessed with free will and fickle 
fancy. I will reveal your weakness, wretched mortal.”
A Celestial Commander
. These valorous angels were 
created to punish the wicked and ensure the sincerity of 
the penitent. When Maligant called his heavenly hosts 
in the war of the Four Divines, the angels marshalled 
out with the other upper echelons under the command 
of the Arch Seraph Empyreus. When Aurelia sacrificed 
herself and revealed the madness of the war, the Angels 
fought on, refusing to admit that they were part of a 
calamitous tragedy, seeing surrender as tantamount to 
blasphemy. With the zeal of a censorious bureaucratic 
tyrant, they now wage a guerilla war with a piecemeal 
retinue of veteran battle angels, zealots, fanatic paladins, 
cohorts of penitent levies, and volunteer convert militia 
auxiliaries as part of an anti-corruption peasant revolt in 
the hinterland of Altenheim.
Fiendish Temptation
. Each Angel keeps a copper 
cage under a velveteen cover inside a lead box encased 
in blessed orichalcum on a thick chain around its neck. 
In the cage is a pathetic, impish fiend of Malikir, withered 
like a raisin. The creature has an uncanny knack for teasing 
out corruption, and compelling wicked behavior in 
mortals. It only takes moments to get a confession once 
a weak-willed mortal has revealed their true self in the 
presence of the fiend.
A Corrupted Temperance
. An Angel of Empyreus 
uses its original orders as a pretext for further violence. 
It will never surrender. Surrender is a trick of the enemy. 
It must fulfill its purpose: to root out corruption and 
sin, and it will do anything to find sin in mortal hearts. 
The imp claims to put mortals to the test, and the Angel 
knows what it is doing. It won’t kill the imp, as using the 
imp reveals the innate corruption in mortal souls.

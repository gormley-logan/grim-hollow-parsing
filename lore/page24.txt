Bladewhirl
“After the bladewhirl had its way with them, there weren’t 
nothing left but tiny pieces and blood on the walls.”
Rolling Death.
 A bladewhirl is a mass of blades that 
rapidly spins to burrow into its victims. The fell intelli-
gence animating a bladewhirl exists only to hunt and kill.
Last Resort.
 An evil wizard created the first bladewhirls 
to end a siege on her fortress. Once a bladewhirl is un-
leashed, it doesn’t stop killing. And the construct doesn’t 
discriminate among viable targets. It kills everything.
salvage
When defeated, a bladewhirl falls apart into several 
shortswords and scimitars, along with shattered bits of 
such weapons. One or more of these blades might be a 
magic weapon.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Bladewhirls are 
murderous constructs made from numerous blades.

 A bladewhirl is fast 
and able to jump to great heights. It always attacks the 
creature closest to it. Once a bladewhirl is free to roam 
and attack, it doesn’t stop.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A bladewhirl is immune 
to poison and psychic damage, and it’s resistant to fire. It 
takes magic weapons to harm one effectively.

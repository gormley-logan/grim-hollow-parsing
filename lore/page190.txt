Lich Troll
“Running away from a troll is smart. Running away 
from a troll that casts spells is wishful thinking.”
Botched Experiment.
 Before research led to the creation 
of the first soul vessel and lich, desperate wizards made 
many failed attempts in the pursuit of immortality. Given 
that trolls return to a hale, hearty state after most injuries, 
some wizards decided inserting the soul into a troll’s 
body might be the right course. The results were poor.
Obscene Amalgamation.
 Most lich trolls look like a 
humanoid skull with burning eyes atop a troll’s body. 
Due to the imperfect process, the creature lost some of 
its arcane power. It gained the benefit of the body of a 
regenerating giant.

Someone who has proficiency with jeweler’s tools or 
woodcarver’s tools can fashion the skull of a lich troll 
into a 
ring of regeneration
. Doing so takes materials worth 
5,000 gp, 10 days of work, and a successful DC 15 Intelli-
gence or Wisdom check. Somebody must also cast 
greater 
restoration
 on the ring each day during the process. If the 
ring’s wearer dies while wearing the ring, the soul of the 
lich has a 25 percent chance to take over the corpse and 
use it as a new body. But if the ring is created entirely in 
the area of a 
hallow
 spell with the everlasting rest effect, 
the tie to the lich’s soul is broken
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 The lich troll is remnants 
of early attempts of powerful spellcasters to transfer their 
souls into trolls.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The lich troll is immune 
to poison and resistant to necrotic damage. It regenerates 
and can be killed only by acid, fire, or radiant damage.

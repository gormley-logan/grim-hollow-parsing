Llanna Deyern & 
the Clockwork Horror
“Now it’s just a fanciful story, of course. 
Little girls don’t turn into hulking metal monsters!”
Real Girl
. Llanna Deyern had an idyllic childhood. Her 
parents realized at a young age that she was a wechselkind, 
a sentient clockwork facsimile of a child, but they raised her 
as their own anyway. A curious and mischievous girl, she 
would sneak away to meet up with other children from the 
nearby village.
The Twinning
. On one such night, Llanna met her 
friends in a grove rumored to be an entrance to the fey 
realms. As they played, thundering footsteps echoed 
through the forest. By the time the children ran, the towering 
figure broke through the trees, its antlers stretching into the 
sky above. Llanna doesn’t remember how she escaped, 
but she was the only one who did.
Living to Tell the Tale
. Following the loss of so 
many of the village youth, Llanna was exiled from her home. 
Ever since that event, Llanna experiences blackouts when 
under duress. When this happens, Llanna transforms into 
the Clockwork Horror, a monstrous construct bearing 
a striking resemblance to the Great Beast that stalks 
the Bürach Empire. Although Llanna inconsistently 
recalls snippets of the Clockwork Horror’s actions, she 
has no control over it.
Hunting Season
. Llanna is terrified of her ability to 
transform but has resolved herself to use the Clockwork 
Horror to get justice for the death of her friends. She travels 
through the Bürach Empire in search of heroes to aid her 
in her quest. If the player characters agree to help her track 
and slay the Beast and its minions, she happily joins them, 
even if they have more pressing tasks to resolve first.

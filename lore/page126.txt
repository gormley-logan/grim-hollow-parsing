Garish Augment
“Unnatural growths and limbs protrude from this creature, 
which might have once been a person but is now a monster.”
Patchwork Body.
 Some people do anything for power. 
Those who become garish augments make deals with 
otherworldly powers or experiment with vile magic to 
enhance themselves. Such pursuits often go terribly wrong.
A garish augment might fight with an enormous claw, 
acid spit, quills, or all the above. None are identical. Every 
augment is different, and few who see one ever mistake 
another for it.
Unquenchable Need. 
A garish augment never ceases 
its quest to kill and harvest appendages and organs from 
other creatures to incorporate into its own makeup.
Fiendish or Aberrant Aid.
 The alchemical processes 
necessary to successfully augment doesn’t come from 
magic alone. At some point, the garish augment delved 
into forbidden knowledge, either fiendish or aberrant in 
nature, to successfully bond parts of their victims to their 
living body.
salvage
With 1 hour of work and a successful DC 15 Wisdom 
(Survival) check, the acid- or poison-producing organ of 
a garish augment can be harvested to provide one vial 
of acid or two doses of basic poison.
However, unless fiendish pieces of the creature are 
burned, the fiend whom the garish augment dealt with 
might come seeking payment from the augment’s killers.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion or Arcana):
 This 
creature’s strange augmentations give it a variety of 
attacks and means of movement.

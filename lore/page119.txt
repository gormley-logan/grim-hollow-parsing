Fate Cat
“You kicked the cat off the roof and it died? Fella, you have 
made the worst enemy of your life, and your afterlife.”
Bringing The Fate
. A fate cat is what happens from 
time to time when a cat has been killed unjustly and for 
no reason. Usually they reappear with a white mark 
reminiscent of how they died, such as a skull pattern in 
their fur for poison.
More Than Nine Lives
. No matter what is done, the 
fate cat always comes back. It regenerates from grievous 
wounds, and even creates new bodies if the old one is lost.
Magical Tricksters
. The fate cat can cast spells to make 
worse the life of its killer. From small illusions to major 
teleportation, the fate cat has many tools at its disposal.
salvage
A fate cat is difficult to kill, but if someone were to 
obtain a permanently deceased fate cat eye, one could 
craft an 
ioun stone of regeneration
 with a successful DC 25 
Intelligence (Arcana) check by a proficient jeweler. This 
would take 50 days and use 10,000 gp of components.

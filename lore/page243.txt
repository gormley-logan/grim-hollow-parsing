Defeated ogresh might carry currency from far-flung 
kingdoms, unusual herbs or spices, or letters from 
friends. Despite their wanderlust, ogresh rarely become 
adventurers, so magic items they possess are more likely 
to facilitate travel or comfort, such as a 
bag of holding
, 
helm of comprehending languages
, or 
ring of animal influence
.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Ogresh are big people 
known for their equally big hearts.
GM Advice:
 Though most ogresh are good-hearted 
creatures, little is worse than an evil one. They use their 
influence to corrupt whole communities. These communities 
tend to do the bidding of their ogresh leader, and often they 
are tricked into not even realizing their actions are vile. 
Such ogresh are as duplicitous others are kind.

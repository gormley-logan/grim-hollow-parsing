Skeleton Troopers
“A line of skeletons marches into the town square with military 
precision. They raise rifles and take aim at the temple in unison.”
Enhanced Undead
. Some necromancers bolster their 
animation rituals with additional, expensive components 
to add to their minions’ powers. For those seeking such 
minions, long-forgotten battlefields and mass graves 
make for fine harvesting.
Blackpowder Enhancements
. It’s possible to infuse 
the defunct blackpowder weapons of the dead with 
necrotic energies to simulate their function in life. These 
weapons are useless in living hands but are potent in the 
clutches of the dead. Such skeleton riflers work in tandem 
with skeleton warriors raised to provide frontline defense.
Stationed farther out than skeleton riflers, teams of 
skeleton cannoneers provide artillery support to deal with 
threats at longer range. The cannons are cumbersome and 
take effort to “load” and fire, so skeleton cannoneers work 
in pairs. One loads, which is a mimed activity that charges 
the otherwise useless cannon, and the other fires. If one 
of the two-corpse team is destroyed, the other cannoneer 
joins another fire team or the main army’s ranks

Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can treat a seraph’s feather to create a charm against 
falling. Creating the charm takes one celestial feather, 
2 hours of work, and reagents worth 50 gp. When a 
creature that carries or wears the charm falls more than 
15 feet, the charm triggers, slowing the rate of descent to 
60 feet per round. Provided the creature touches ground 
again in 1 minute, the creature takes no falling damage 
and can land on its feet. Once one charm triggers, no 
other charm carried by the same creature triggers until 
the magic from the first charm ends. After a charm 
provides its magic for 1 minute or the user ceases 
falling, the charm crumbles to inert dust.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion):
 After the gods’ 
disappearance, the Arch Seraphs descended upon 
Etharis, seeking to impose their will and combat evil 
in person. Angels and lesser celestials have come to 
be a more common sight since then.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 An Arch Seraph can 
gift a worthy mortal with the might of a lesser celestial. 
These lesser celestials boast potent defenses and powers, 
allowing them to rush headlong to battle those they view 
as evil. Most lesser celestials are as uncompromising as 
their Arch Seraph leaders.

Maiden’s Hair
Beware the woods, Beware the night,
Beware the hair of golden light
--Excerpt from a Bürach nursery rhyme
Forest Blight
. Maiden’s hair is a deadly plant found in 
remote forests. They resemble long flowing tufts of golden 
grass or moss, frequently hanging from tree limbs.
Delusional Scent
. The maiden’s hair releases a 
poisonous scent, barely noticeable by most humanoids. 
However, intelligent creatures affected by this poison 
become enamored with the plant. Poisoned victims 
who survive encounters with maiden’s hair describe 
visions of an attractive individual with long flowing 
hair calling them forward.
Hag’s Favorite
. Hags often cultivate these plants 
to protect their dismal lairs, leaving skeletons of past 
victims beneath the deadly plants to warn potential 
intruders of the danger.

Individuals proficient with weaver’s tools can use the 
fibrous remains of one maiden’s hair to craft exceptionally 
resilient nets. An individual spending 8 hours and 
succeeding on a DC 10 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) 
check can craft a 
net of maiden’s hair
 (see Chapter 4).

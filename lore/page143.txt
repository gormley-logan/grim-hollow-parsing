Gripper
“Once you hear the hiss, it’s already too late.”
Blighted Remains.
 Grippers are the remains of 
forests, drained of life. Fungus gorged on the corpses. 
What remains, besides rot, are these pale, knotty beings 
of vine and mold that straddle the worlds of living and 
dead without being undead. The danger of a gripper is 
mostly that it can pass its rot along.
Preternatural Senses.
 A gripper lacks senses typical 
to humanoids, but it can sense others by their spiritual 
presence and navigate via the echoes of its clicking.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
or brewer’s supplies can use the spore sacs from three 
grippers as a base for a 
potion of malice 
(see chapter 
4). Making the potion takes 3 days of work and other 
reagents worth 100 gp, and the brewer must succeed 
on a DC 10 Intelligence or Wisdom check to get the 
mixture right.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 The grippers got their 
name from the fact that they grab and constrict their 
prey. They usually bite what they grab.
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Grippers look woody, 
but they have a lot of soft parts, making them vulnerable 
to slashing damage.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 Grippers can release 
rot-inducing spores. If they haven’t done so before they 
die, they swell with pressure before releasing the spores 
in a wider area.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A gripper exists in a 
state between life and death yet not undead. It can sense 
spirits, even those within living beings, and it uses its 
clicking to navigate. Its ability to sense spirits extends 
into the Ethereal Plane.

Laethlyn
“Only the desperate would call on the ‘mercy’ of the Laethlyn. 
She has none. And if she decides that you’ve committed a 
crime against the land she protects, you may suffer a worse 
fate than any you were trying to escape.”
Defender of Nature
. The Laethlyn, a powerful 
fey creature that works outside the politics of the fey 
courts, is deeply connected to the natural spaces of 
Etharis. They brook no intrusion by those who do not 
have those same interests at heart. The Laethlyn tends 
to plants and beasts of the wilderness, raising them to 
be both companions and defenses against incursions 
by the so-called civilized world. They also attempt to 
heal those creatures who’ve succumbed to the mutating 
powers of the Beast. However, if healing is impossible, 
they consider a quick death a mercy and an obligation. 
They also see lycanthropes and undead as abominations 
that need cleansing off the face of Etharis.
Druidic Knowledge
. After generations of walking 
the isolated forests of Etharis, the Laethlyn is a source 
of much esoteric lore. To those who prove themselves 
allies, rather than threats, the Laethlyn could be an 
unparalleled source of knowledge and history for druids 
and others who want a deeper understanding of the 
natural world or the things that endanger it.
Beautiful and Dangerous
. The Laethlyn appears 
as a lithe elven form with delicate antlers and the light 
fur of a deer. Closer examination, however, reveals that 
their fur hides strong vines and barbed thorns, which 
are devastating when used as weapons.

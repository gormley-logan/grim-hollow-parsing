salvage
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can use 1 pint of blood from a fzeg and mix it with silver 
and other reagents worth 50 gp to create a 
lycanthropy 
antidote
 (see chapter 4). A slain fzeg has 10 (1d4 + 2) 
usable pints of blood. The blood of a fzeglaich can be 
used, but it takes five times as much blood and twice as 
long to brew. Creating the antidote takes 4 hours of work 
and a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Religion) check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A fzeg is a mix of 
werewolf and vampire but has fewer weaknesses. 
The creature is resistant to nonmagical attacks.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 With its bite, a fzeg 
can drain life force and curse a person with werewolf 
lycanthropy. Someone who dies from a fzeg’s bite 
becomes a fzeglaich, a creature like the fzeg and loyal to it.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A fzeg can transform 
into humanoid form. It’s natural form, however, is that 
of a wolf-human hybrid. This vampiric monster isn’t 
vulnerable to sunlight, but radiant damage prevents it 
from regenerating.
GM Advice:
 An ambitious DM could imagine a fzeg at the 
lead of a force including other werewolf-undead hybrids. 
Combined with a ghoul or ghast, the creature would paralyze, 
or combined with a wight, it would drain the life and lower 
the maximum hit points of a target. Similarly, other kinds of 
lycanthropes could become undead and wield hybrid powers.

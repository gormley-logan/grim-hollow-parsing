Night Serpent
“Stories say that Malikir sends night serpents to poison 
heroes that they might fail to act in a critical moment. 
I think they just like biting everyone.”
Abyssal Snakes
. Night serpents are violet-scaled 
snakes native to the infernal realms, who’s poisonous 
bite temporarily paralyzes its victims.
Untrustworthy Followers
. Night serpents are attracted 
to fiends or mortals who wield great power. They frequently 
sneak into the lairs of those who oppose the ones they 
serve to kill them when they are unprepared. Eventually 
the night serpents grow bored of those they follow and 
turn on them as well.
Light’s Enemy
. Night serpents are creatures of 
darkness. They are less effective in the light and are 
vulnerable to radiant effects.

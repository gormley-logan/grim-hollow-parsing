Kokela
“If its hum can kill while it’s still asleep, 
imagine what it could do if it wakes up.”
Apocalypse Altar.
 A living shrine listening for a long-
lost melody, the kokela sleeps, waiting for the one who 
returns that song. This mysterious tune can kill, but only 
the kokela—this song’s creator—can use it to bring about 
the end of all things.
Corrupted Call.
 During the kokela’s slumber, it emits 
a hum that kills anything nearby and eventually cracks 
stone and softens the earth. This vibration can also call 
an individual on the same plane as the kokela to find the 
kokela’s lost song.
Such a “chosen one” relentlessly seeks the song and 
anything that can aid in the search, from knowledge to 
wealth. When the task is complete, the kokela’s hum 
guides the chosen one to it. In the kokela’s presence, the 
chosen one succumbs to the kokela’s dream. Thereby, 
the chosen one gains an audience with the slumbering 
aberration to remind it of the apocalypse song.
Then, the kokela sings in the end of the world.

Upon defeat, the kokela and its dream disappear, 
revealing its true form, a 
malleus macabre
 (see chapter 4), 
a blunt, jagged, bonelike object that jitters and peeps. A 
mortal can use this object, but it is a testament to the kokela. 
The kokela can be defeated, but it can never truly die.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The kokela is the remains 
of some long-dead or absent being. It slumbers, but it 
affects the world around it with its dreams, creating a 
nightmare landscape. The kokela also reverberates with 
a hum that can kill creatures and damage objects.

Champions of Filth
“Our blight shall purify this land of the meek 
and the unworthy. Etharis will be reborn.”
Illness and Opportunity.
 When the Weeping Pox 
struck Liesech, many fled the city ahead of the Bürach 
Empire’s quarantine. After their tales had time to 
spread, the troops stationed outside the city were 
astonished that knights wanted to gain passage inside. 
These self-proclaimed Champions of Filth saw the 
new virulent disease as an embodiment of their belief 
in decay and corruption.
Prophets of Pestilence.
 The Champions of Filth gave 
themselves over to the Weeping Pox, seeking to purify 
themselves in its horrifying embrace. Most succumbed to 
the disease, but a few emerged changed by the experience. 
Their bodies had become hosts to an altered form of 
the disease, granting them control over its spread and 
symptoms. These few managed to break out of quarantine, 
the guards’ flesh withering before the knights’ new powers. 
Now they roam free, seeking to spread their grisly gospel.

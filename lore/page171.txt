Insic
“Don’t go blowing into any old instrument without 
giving it a good look. Might be something in there 
you’d rather not inhale…”
Bard Enemy.
 Finding an old instrument can be cause 
for great excitement for a bard, but an insic quickly puts a 
damper on that feeling. This undead inhabits abandoned 
instruments. It jealously guards its silent home, preferring 
to keep the echoes of long-lost music to itself.
Musical Magic.
 Many insics are born from the spirits 
of musicians torn apart by their craft or so dedicated to it 
that death couldn’t stop them. Insics retain a connection 
to musical magic. They can also overpower the mind of a 
kindred spirit to perform again for a short time.
salvage
Insics prefer fine, old instruments that are valuable or 
would be if restored. Some such instruments are magical.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 An insic is a mass of 
shadows that likes to live inside old musical instruments. 
The best way to check for an insic is to shine a light into 
an instrument. If shadows persist, an insic could be there.
DC 20 Intelligence (History): 
An old story tells of 
a famous musician who performed without rest, barely 
sleeping or eating for the better part of two years. He 
passed away from exhaustion. His lyre became the 
home of an insic soon after. Some suspect he had been 
possessed by one, perhaps the same one. Others think 
his spirit became the insic that inhabited his lyre.

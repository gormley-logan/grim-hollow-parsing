GM Advice:
 Bugbears fear very little, but Tormachâ€™s Rage is 
an exception. In the few places in Etharis where bugbears have 
not succumbed to the disease, stopping its spread or reversing 
it might be one bargaining chip that characters have to strike 
a bargain. A more advanced version of the disease, creating an 
even more dangerous bugbear, is always a possibility as well.

Bloody Avenue
“The rulers of this city hold supreme power over 
its population, crushing rebels in the streets. Or 
sometimes crushing rebels with the streets.”
Grisly Masonry.
 The lengths to which evil dictators 
go to maintain power beggars the imagination. Wicked 
minions, obedient thralls, and greedy mercenaries are 
all tools to hold sway over a population. One of the most 
horrifying and imaginative instruments, however, is the 
bloody avenue.
Arcanists mix the blood and bones of slain foes with 
the masonry of city streets, making them weapons of 
subjugation. The ritual connects the senses of the bloody 
avenue to other servants of the city’s overlord. Using 
this bond, bloody avenues deliver information to other 
agents in the city.
Stone and Bone.
 When a bloody avenue attacks, dirt, 
stone, and bone coalesce into a malleable snakelike form. 
It can mire anyone standing on it when it activates, and it 
can slam nearby enemies or hurl rubble at them.
salvage
Part of the ritual to create a bloody avenue requires jet 
gems and diamonds. Among the rubble of the construct, 
gems worth 500 gp can be found with a 10-minute 
search. Each successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) 
or Wisdom (Perception) check made during this search 
cuts the time in half, to a minimum of 1 minute.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (History): 
Rulers with few scru-
ples and access to powerful arcane rituals have turned 
streets into guardian constructs. The telltale signs of this 
ritual are blood and bone in the masonry and tiny runes 
on the cobbles.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A bloody avenue is 
hard to escape—it mires those around it in rubble. It can 
also alert other beings, such as the city watch.

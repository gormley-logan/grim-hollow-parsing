Anguisher
“Some suffering never ends. It coalesces 
in cold darkness, gaining alien sapience.”
Aberrant Torment.
 Mental suffering can last far 
longer than physical damage. Psychic energy from 
those who die in extreme anguish might open a portal, 
allowing consciousness from beyond the veil to meld 
with psychic residue.
Old Wounds.
 The touch or aura of an anguisher calls 
old wounds and tormentors to mind. The creature uses 
invisibility and stealth to lurk around potential victims, 
slowly draining them of life through this recalled suffering.
salvage
An anguisher discorporates into thick, black goo when 
slain. Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s 
supplies can refine and dehydrate this goo in a process 
that takes 1 day of work and a successful DC 10 Intelligence 
or Wisdom check. If it succeeds, the process creates 
dust 
of disappearance
.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Anguishers are 
semisolid horrors from beyond reality.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 An anguisher shares 
many traits and immunities with semicorporeal undead, 
such as shadows. If an anguisher slays a sapient creature, 
a new anguisher emerges into the world near the corpse 
3 days later.

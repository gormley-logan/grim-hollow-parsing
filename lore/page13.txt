Apparmarole
“Be properly attired, lest ye be mistaken 
for a thrall of the apparmarole.”
Dominating Clothes
. No one knows who constructed 
the first apparmarole, but now they are a plague on the 
world. The apparmarole looks to be a set of clothing that 
flies into the air and wraps around a humanoid victim, 
taking control of their actions.
Driven to Replicate
. Once in control of a host and 
not threatened, the apparmarole directs it to create more 
apparmaroles, a process that takes 100 days and requires 
500 gp of rare threads and textiles. If the host does not 
have the funds or materials, the apparmarole attempts to 
steal them.
Mine or No One Else’s
. The apparmarole can constrict 
any creature it grapples; a slow crushing death is the fate 
of any humanoid that resists the apparmarole’s charm.
salvage
The threads of an apparmarole contain trace amounts of 
magic and are valuable as components for the construction 
of several magical items. They can be sold for 50 gp if 
the apparmarole was not consumed by flame.
Someone who collects the remains of ten apparmaroles 
can craft a 
cloak of protection
 with a successful DC 15 Intelli-
gence (Arcana) check by someone proficient with weaver’s 
tools. Crafting this item takes 5 days and costs 200 gp.

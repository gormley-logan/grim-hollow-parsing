GM Advice:
 In campaigns where humanoid beings like 
humans are a main foe, GMs may often find that there is a 
lack of diverse humanoid foes. In cases when this happens, 
reskinning monsters is a valuable tool. Reskinning simply 
means taking an existing monster, keeping the statistics 
exactly the same, but describing the creature and its 
abilities in a different way to match the needed foe. 
Any of the arcanists here, or any of the other humanoid 
monsters in this book, are easy to reskin.
An inquisitor hunter can be used to represent any hunter-type 
NPC. Inquisitor priests can be a stand-in for any creature 
or humanoid that uses both weapons and magic. Knights 
can be altered to represent any powerful armored foe. 
The underlying math works, regardless of how you describe 
the attacks or the spells that the enemy uses.

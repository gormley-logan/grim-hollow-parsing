DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Ithjars are fast-moving 
ferocious fliers, but the more powerful of these flying 
serpents are imbued with the power of storms and can 
exhale lightning and thunder.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 It’s difficult to capture 
an ithjar. They slither out of an enemy’s clutches and 
other restraints quickly and easily.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The stormborn ithjar is 
immune to lightning and thunder, allowing it to travel 
within storm clouds.

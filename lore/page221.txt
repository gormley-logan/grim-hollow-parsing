Variant: Sootling Familiar
Sootlings that have become familiars have the following trait.
Familiar.
 A sootling can partner with another creature 
as a familiar, forming a telepathic bond with this willing 
partner. While the two are bonded, the partner can sense 
what the sootling senses while they are within 1 mile of 
each other. If the partner harms the sootling, the sootling 
ends the telepathic bond and ceases being a familiar.

Shatter Corpse
“The sound of breaking glass startles most, but think 
twice before going to see what caused it if it is followed 
by the sound of moaning.”
Covered in Glass
. When someone dies with glass 
embedded in their skin—such as being stabbed by a 
shard of glass or killed by a falling window—they may 
rise as a shatter corpse. Shards of glass continually grow 
through the skin of a shatter corpse, covering them in 
razor-sharp weapons.
Ponderous and Noisy
. Shatter corpses are no more 
mobile than an average zombie, and the constantly 
breaking glass makes them even easier to hear coming.
Dangerous Volley
. Shatter corpses can flick hails of 
glass shards at nearby creatures. The shards grow back 
within a few seconds.

Outlaw
“Stick to the roads to avoid the monsters of the wild, 
they tell you. The roads aren’t all that safe, I reply!”
Roads of Etharis.
 Travel in Etharis is a dangerous 
proposition. Those who venture beyond the safety of 
city walls often stick to the network of roads laid down 
during the Bürach Empire’s heyday. These roads have 
their own perils, however, as evidenced by the outlaws 
who’ve made highway robbery their trade.
Flamboyant Thievery.
 Outlaws of the road differ 
from usual thieving ruffians in several ways. Traversing 
the roads quickly and keeping pace with carriages and 
wagons means that this breed of bandit relies on horses 
or other mounts. Riding in on horseback makes stealth 
less of an option, so this path attracts those with a flair 
for the dramatic. When a traveler hears a gunshot and a 
boisterous laugh, an outlaw won’t be far off.

The blackpowder pistols outlaws favor are extremely 
rare and valuable. However, rough use and poor 
upkeep comes with a robber lifestyle, which means that 
the pistol requires maintenance before it can be used

Mouruge
“A twisted manifestation claws its way out of the mire, looking 
for warm flesh to feast on, driven by an insatiable hunger.”
Black Mire Born.
 When an evil humanoid falls in the 
Black Mire, vines find the body. They wrap the corpse, 
strip away flesh, and create two belts of bones that 
cross the chest. After transformation, the sapient and 
emotionless mouruge contends with eternal hunger 
for flesh. It roams and consumes all corpses, while the 
bones around its body rattle a warning.
Kindled Hatred.
 Some mouruges were so powerful 
in life that their personality carries into undeath. This 
phenomenon is so rare that no one attempts to become 
a mouruge. Such a kindled mouruge hunts down and 
devours those it hated in life. This hatred manifests in 
mastery of soul fire.
Undead Nature.
 The mouruge doesn’t require air, 
food, drink, or sleep.
salvage
The bones of one mouruge can be ground into a powder. 
When combined with raw meat, mud, and other reagents 
worth 100 gp, the mixture creates a magical substance 
known as 
gristaline
 (see chapter 4).

 A mouruge is driven 
by the need to eat flesh, favoring that of their enemies 
during their living years.

 Kindled mouruges 
can control fire, and they are vulnerable to holy water.

reasoned with.

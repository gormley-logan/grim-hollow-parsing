Doomcaller
“Despair, the end is nigh!”
Apocalyptic Prophet
. Wrapped in bandages and 
a cloak, the fiend plays at being a prophet predicting 
dark times ahead. With the presence of a doomcaller, its 
predictions are all too real.
Tongue of Tongues
. When the doomcaller speaks, all 
understand, and it understands all that is said.
One of Many
. When the doomcaller needs to reinforce 
its pronouncements of doom, it summons succubi or 
other fiends to spread fear and despair.
salvage
When slain, the eyes of a doomcaller harden into gems 
worth 2000 gp each.
When a creature holding one of these gems makes 
an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they can 
consume it to improve their fortunes. After the roll has 
been made, but before the GM has announced the result 
of the roll, the player can expend one gem and reroll the 
roll. Once done, the player must use the new result, the 
gem shatters and becomes worthless.

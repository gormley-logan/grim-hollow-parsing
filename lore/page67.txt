GM Advice:
 Bards of the College of Requiems can 
make challenging and flavorful villains in their own rights. 
However, when teamed up with a powerful necromancer or 
an intelligent undead leader, these mourning minstrels and 
dirgemasters truly shine.
Rather than having a traditional bard playing at their courts 
and singing their praises, a vampire lord would have a 
dirgemaster in its employ instead. Not only is that pairing 
more appropriate in terms of the story, the dirgemaster can 
bolster its master and the servants of the creature with the 
necromantic magic the bard wields.
On the other hand, in a town overrun with undead, a College of 
Requiems bard might be the only thing standing between the 
undead creatures it can influence and the innocent townsfolk. 
While these bards may be frightening to commoners, their 
power can be wielded for good as much as ill.

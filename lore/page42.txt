Bolejack
“The logger stands before the tree, a look of 
infatuation in his eyes. He grips his axe tighter as 
he turns to face the rest of his logging crew.”
Dryad Thralls.
 Monster hunters and sages know that 
some fey spirits who fall in love with mortals are bound 
to trees and changed into dryads, remaining forever 
young while their tree is kept safe. This bound state 
doesn’t rob the dryad of power. Every so often, a dryad 
becomes interested in a person moving through her 
territory. She uses her charms and fey magic to make 
them into her thrall.
Woodcutter’s Peril.
 Since a dryad lives within 
a forested grove, a significant number of those she 
encounters are woodcutters. A bolejack is a woodcutter 
who has won the trust of a dryad. If what they share is 
not love, the infatuation is strong enough for her to grant 
the bolejack some of her fey power.
Varied Devotion.
 A bolejack protects the dryad when 
her charms fail. Bolejacks are varied in their devotion to 
the dryad when her enchantment is removed. A bolejack 
is as likely to attack as to thank those who slay or subdue 
the dryad, breaking the bond between the two.
salvage
A bolejack’s axes remain magical for 24 hours after the 
bolejack is freed or killed. Someone attuned to the axe 
who succeeds on a DC 10 Charisma check can maintain 
that magic for another 24 hours. Once the check fails, 
the magic dissipates forever.

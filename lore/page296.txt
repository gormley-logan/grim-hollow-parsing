Seraph
“The only thing worse than facing a daemon is 
facing a seraph who thinks you’re doing wrong.”
Shattered Hierarchies.
 The disappearance of the 
gods shattered the governing order of the celestial host. 
Leaderless and adrift, the Arch Seraphs took it upon 
themselves to lead mortals to the path of righteousness. 
It became apparent that each Arch Seraph had a different 
idea of that path. Soon, each Arch Seraph led their own 
campaign against perceived evils, which usually meant 
whatever disagreed with their personal goals.
Religious Intolerance.
 Lacking the power of gods, 
the Arch Seraphs sought to spread their influence and 
increase their power by any means necessary. Mortals 
are the weapons and the prize in this conflict. Rather 
than entice with contracts, as Arch Daemons do, the 
Arch Seraphs chose to take a firm stance on doctrine. 
Either you’re with them, or you’re against them.

Hraptnon
“The magic our wizard used just bounced off the gigantic 
creature, and as our fighter slashed at it with her sword, 
the creature’s blood spawned even more monsters.”
Stillborn Forest Scourge.
 Enterprising loggers. 
Hiding bandits. Hardy stonemasons. Treasure hunters. 
Many attempt to form bases of operation among the 
gigantic trunks and thick foliage of the Stillborn Forest. 
And many succeed at establishing thriving bases thanks 
to the ample bounty that the forest provides. Or at least 
until the hraptnon finds them. Then it’s nothing but 
blood and screams.
Born of Hag Magic.
 The hraptnon was born centuries 
ago, when a coven of hags lairing in the Stillborn Forest 
used magic to enhance the capabilities of a normal ogre 
who they’d enchanted to protect them. The coven died 
out, but the creature lived on to be adopted by another 
coven, which added more magical enhancements. This 
cycle continued decade after decade, and the resulting 
creature grew in size and power. Now the hraptnon 
is beyond control, with nothing in its soul except for an 
undying urge to eat those who wield magic.
The Stillborn Heart
. The secret of the hraptnon 
lives buried in the center the Stillborn Forest, beneath a 
pool of clear water in a grove of magical trees. Magical 
damage cannot harm the hraptnon while the heart rests 
in the pool. The grove is guarded by xakalonus the 
murderous offspring of the hraptnon.

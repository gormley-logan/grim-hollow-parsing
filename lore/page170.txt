I
Inkwalker
“Along your journeys, you may encounter creatures 
that seem quite familiar, and may beckon you towards 
them. Always be weary however, as sometimes, the 
one’s beckoning you are more than they seem.”
Mimic Heritage
. These creatures are cousins to mimics, 
with shapeshifting abilities that allow them to counterfeit 
animals. They can’t get it quite right, however, as they 
appear to be covered in an inky substance. This normally 
leads them to hunt from a distance, hide in plain sight as 
other objects, and take more animalistic forms. Most can 
only take the form of Small or smaller creatures, ranging 
from cats to rats to dogs.
Voices of the Prey
. The inkwalker can copy the 
sounds it hears and those of the prey it consumes to 
lure its prey into its den. With this, it normally stalks 
from afar, as its silhouette is convincing, yet its form’s 
details are not. It is also able to speak brief phrases, 
mimicking people it has heard.

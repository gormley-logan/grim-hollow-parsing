Ordeal Tree
“In the primeval wood rises the ordeal tree. Should 
you hang from this hoary pillar of begone time for 
seven moons, you will gain power of the ancients.”
Hidden Danger.
 Much like a treant, an ordeal tree 
is capable of movement or even speech, but it rarely 
does so, preferring to tempt victims into believing it’s a 
magical tree.
The Worst Are Best.
 An ordeal tree only grants power 
to those with the capacity to do great evil. Those with 
pure hearts are simply murdered.
Power with Cost.
 The ordeal tree’s blessing, if granted 
at all, comes with a curse.

The heartwood of an ordeal tree can be turned into an 
incense that, when inhaled, acts as a cure for removing 
powerful curses. Obtaining the wood requires a 
successful DC 15 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check 
by someone proficient with woodcarver’s tools. 
Recovering and preparing this incense takes 15 days 
and costs 1000 gp, also requiring a successful DC 20 
Intelligence (Religion) check.

Meyana
“Some people eat only plants. A few plants 
are happy to return the favor.”
Hunting Plants.
 Meyanas are bipedal plant creatures 
that walk on leglike roots, and they can use tools they hold 
in appendages resembling arms. These appendages end in 
pincers that can hold and utilize tools.
A meyana can be up to 7 feet tall. Its torso is most of 
that, with a long, grasping frond that resembles a clam 
shell. This torso frond is big enough to “swallow” an 
adult human. Inside these fronds, meyanas digest flesh 
into a nutrient goo the creature can absorb. A meyana 
uses leftover bones as tools, weapons, or decorations.
Several stalks grow out of a meyana’s body, and 
the meyana uses these to sense the environment. (A 
meyana has no head.) Holes in these stalks allow the 
meyana to communicate with vocalizations. Most 
meyanas speak Sylvan.
Meyanas reproduce by shedding one mature “hand.” 
This pod then grows into a new meyana. An infant starts 
at about a foot long, but after feasting on meat, the baby 
can grow to full size in 6 months.

Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can use the leaves of one adult meyana to brew a 
potion 
of greater healing
. Doing so takes 4 hours of work and a 
successful DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 The woody, plantlike 
structure of a meyana makes the creature resistant to 
piercing damage. Anyone trapped in the plant’s central 
body risks being quickly digested.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 Meyanas can sense the 
footfalls of those moving on the ground.

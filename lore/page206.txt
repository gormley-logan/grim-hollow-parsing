Malcinder
“A shadowy form moves silently toward its 
 prey, stalking with precision. Sudden flames 
erupt as the malcinder roars and leaps into the 
air to crush its target to the ground.”
Infernal Hunters.
 Malcinders sometimes escaped 
the Netherworld, forming small hunting packs found in 
every region. They suppress their infernal nature when 
hunting and resting for stealth, dusky skin concealing 
them in the darkness.
Born in Flames.
 When a malcinder attacks, its body 
hardens like cooling lava, and flames glow through its 
skull. It harnesses this infernal fire within its whiplike 
tail to hurl flame.
Burning Leader.
 The strongest of malcinders leads a 
pack. This alpha is the largest in the group and the best 
hunter. A malcinder alpha draws attention so the pack 
can attack from all sides.
salvage
When a malcinder dies, the flames within its body go out, 
and the corpse hardens like volcanic rock. The claws and 
fangs from one malcinder corpse make a powder that 
someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can make into a 
potion of speed
. Doing so requires other 
reagents worth 1,000 gp, 8 hours of work, and a successful 
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion:
 Malcinders are fiends 
immune to fire.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 A malcinder alpha 
coordinates its pack efficiently. Slaying this leader can 
make the pack much less dangerous.
Malcinders are prone to following stronger fiends. 
Therefore, a creature with fiendish ancestry can 
tame a malcinder.

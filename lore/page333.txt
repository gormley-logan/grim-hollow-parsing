DC 10 Intelligence (Nature)
: Tachnae have never 
been known to inhabit wood carvings or stone 
monuments due to their close ties to the natural world.
DC 15 Intelligence (History)
: A well-known art 
district became infested with tachnae once. The entire 
section of town was abandoned and cordoned off.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana)
: A tachna forms a 
sentient demiplane within warped works of art. The 
belongings of those killed by a tachna spill onto the 
ground, along with the survivors who vanquish it.

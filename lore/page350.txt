Urban Ooze
“I thought I’d found a place under the street where no 
one would find me, but then the sewage moved.”
Tainted Waste.
 In the polluted recesses of urban 
environments, masses of sewage and trash sometimes 
congeal with the leavings of other oozes to form an 
urban ooze. These repulsive creatures are nearly 
invisible in the cesspools they live in.
Disgusting Death.
The ooze’s fetid form is filled 
with pestilence. Being near it can be dangerous. But the 
creature is a hunter. Prey it doesn’t kill and devour, it 
drags to the bottom of cesspits to bury beneath layers of 
putrefaction for later consumption.
Ooze Nature.
 An urban ooze doesn’t require sleep.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with a poisoner’s kit can 
use the remains of a diminished urban ooze and other 
reagents worth 25 gp to make one dose of basic poi-
son. This poison remains potent for 1 hour instead of 
1 minute. Making one dose takes 4 hours and requires a 
successful DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom check.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 An urban ooze is living 
waste. The stinking air around it is full of pestilence, and 
so is its touch.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature):
 When wounded, 
an urban ooze can break into smaller oozes. One can 
quickly become four.

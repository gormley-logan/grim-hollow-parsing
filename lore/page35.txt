Blood Ooze
“I was never too fond of pets. But I never thought they’d be 
terrifying until I saw a lord feeding a prisoner to his blood ooze.”
Bloody Pets. 
Vampires and practitioners of blood magic 
keep blood oozes as pets. They are clever enough to learn 
tricks, especially if rewarded with living creatures as food. 
Even roughly trained, blood oozes can keep watch in 
areas susceptible to infiltration, such as waterways or 
secret passages.
Trainable Servants.
 Well-trained blood oozes have 
a penchant for understanding what their masters want. 
The ooze can take different shapes to please or entertain. 
They follow simple instructions, but an ooze might be 
distracted by a potential meal.
salvage
A blood ooze ejects what its prey wore or carried. That 
means, provided no one collects these leavings, treasure 
can be found in and around the ooze’s lair. An ooze’s 
keepers usually collect anything of real value, however.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Sapient creatures that 
revel in blood, such as vampires, like to keep blood oozes. 
These terrifying jellies act quickly when they scent blood, 
and they can dissolve a living creature to acid-scarred 
bones in a matter of moments.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 Stories speak of blood 
oozes guarding the dungeons of evil creatures. Would-be 
heroes run afoul of these terrors in damp passages beneath 
more than one fabled castle.

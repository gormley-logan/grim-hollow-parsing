Corpse Wisp
“Some crypts are lit by lanterns.  
Others by the fragments of lost souls.”
Soul Remnants.
 Sometimes a soul stays in the mortal 
world to haunt the living. More often, wicked spiritual 
remnants stay behind to haunt the body’s final rest. These 
remnants form weird, dead lights—corpse wisps—that 
float in graveyards and other places of death, searching 
for the living to feed on.
These fragments have little sense of the creatures they 
once were. Still, they cling to the body they once inhabit-
ed. Hunger can’t destroy them, but they crave life force.
Undead Nature.
 A corpse wisp doesn’t require air, 
drink, food, or sleep.
salvage
When a corpse wisp is destroyed, it leaves behind a soft, 
black rock the size of a coin. This “coal” can be used as 
an extra material component when casting a spell that 
deals necrotic damage. Used in this manner, the coal 
causes the spell to deal an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. 
Using the coal in this way consumes it.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 These lights, called 
corpse wisps, are undead spirit fragments caught 
between life and the great beyond.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 Corpse wisps are 
nearly immaterial. Radiant damage is most effective 
against them, while poison, necrotic, and damage from 
nonmagical attacks are least effective.

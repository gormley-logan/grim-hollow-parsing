Gozomite
“I avoid caves. Not because I am afraid of the dark, but 
because I am afraid of the gozomites living there.”
Night Crawlers.
 Insectoid gozomites despise bright 
lights and haunt underground places, only venturing 
above ground on dark nights.
Parasitic Lifecycle.
 Gozomites breed by stinging 
mammals with their bulbous stinger and injecting 
hundreds of eggs. Mammalian blood quickens the eggs, 
which hatch into a swarm of gozomitelings and quickly 
devour the victim. 
Vulnerable to Fire.
 Gozomite ichor is particularly 
flammable and is prized by alchemists. 
salvage
It takes 4 hours to harvest and bottle 1d4 doses of ichor 
from a gozomite that did not die from fire damage. 
As an action, you can splash the gozomite ichor onto 
a creature within 5 feet of you or throw a flask of it up 
to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack 
against a target creature or object, treating the ichor as 
an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered 
in ichor and if the target takes any fire damage before 
the ichor dries (within 3 rounds), the target takes an 
additional 14 (4d6) fire damage.

DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Gegazol, Scourge of the 
North, is an ancient dragon transformed into an undead 
horror millennia ago. Tales as old as creation tell of her 
infrequent but violent assaults on lands south of her lair, 
and all lands of Etharis are south of her lair.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 Not only possessing 
great physical power, defenses against magic, and an 
undead army at her back, Gegazol, like a lich, has a soul 
vessel that harbors her undead soul and can rejuvenate 
her body when Gegazol is destroyed. It’s said that this 
vessel is a massive daemon skull, and that the dragon 
keeps it hidden in her lair.
DC 20 Intelligence (History):
 Gegazol calls the 
undead who serve her Immortals’. Among them are 
vampires, ghouls, and undead that are even more 
powerful. Given many of these undead have fallen 
in her wars and powerplays, the Immortal title 
is aspirational.

Chapter 2: Vampires
“The lifeblood of a creature isn’t necessarily just… blood. It can 
be hopes, dreams, goals or love. Some vampires sup on those.”
T
he curse of vampirism is known to the commoners 
of Etharis. A vile corruption of body and mind, it 
twists the heart while devouring the soul of one so 
afflicted. Vampires share traits gained in their transition from 
mortal life, but from there, their paths vary.

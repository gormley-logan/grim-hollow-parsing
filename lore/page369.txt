Wretched Celebrants
“Each year we have a festival to celebrate the 
dead. It’s great fun, unless the dead join us.”
Joyful Dead.
 Across Etharis, festivals celebrate the 
dead. The details might change, but the atmosphere is 
one of elation and excess. Participants eat and drink 
heartily, wear elaborate costumes, and hold parades 
with dazzling floats. Sometimes, however, the dead 
walk disguised among the living.
Awful Jubilation.
 Scholars argue about the reason 
undead creatures appear at these festivals. Some say the 
jubilant atmosphere draws the dead, while others claim 
the dead feed upon the energy of the crowds. If someone 
interrupts the celebration, undead revelers turn violent, 
using eldritch might to attack the party-poopers.

Wretched celebrants often carry or wear ornate objects. 
They’re dressed to party.
The wretched master of ceremonies’ whip retains 
some of its magic. In the hands of a creature attuned to 
it, this magic whip deals an extra 2d4 psychic damage to 
any target it hits.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Wretched celebrants 
are rare, but they sometimes appear at festivals and 
carnivals that celebrate the dead.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 Wretched revelers and 
drivers are motivated by the fun and excess of these 
celebrations, and they attack only if they are revealed 
or if the revelries are halted prematurely. The wretched 
master of ceremonies, however, comes to a celebration 
hoping to cause chaos. Other wretched celebrants follow 
the master’s lead.

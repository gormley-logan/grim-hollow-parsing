Cult of Tormach
“The wounded soldier’s hopes soar as an ally approaches after 
battle. But the look in her eye tells the soldier that no help will 
come from this cultist of Tormach.”
Military Power Cult.
 In the uncertainty following 
the Aetheric War, the absence of the previous deity of 
war, Malignant, paved the way for the worship of the 
unhinged Arch Daemon Tormach. People of Unterland 
birthed the Cult of Tormach within their militaristic 
nation. Many fear the cult’s influence will spread if 
left unchecked.
Mindless Destruction.
 The rank and file of the Cult 
of Tormach carry a well-deserved reputation for wrath 
and destruction, their zealotry synonymous with the 
shedding of blood without reason. Cultists of Tormach 
do not give themselves over to a true berserker state 
but prefer to attack to overwhelm and dismember their 
opponents. They have a reputation for slaughtering their 
wounded at the conclusion of a battle. Unterlanders have 
learned to expect no quarter from Tormach’s faithful.
Champion of Tormach. 
Tormach touches certain 
fighters to their core, giving them the strength and fury 
necessary to deliver great damage. In battle, Tormach’s 
Champions prefer the vanguard, armored as much by the 
strength of faith and their patron’s daemonic blessings as 
their physical armor.
Tormach Zealot.
 The most faithful disciples of Tor-
mach, blessed with wicked powers, lead the rest of the 
cult in bizarre and sickening ceremonies and chants. 
While Zealots let Champions and other servants of Tor-
mach rush into battle first, they’re more than willing to 
fight and die in Tormach’s name.

Rarely, one of the weapons a cultist carries retains the 
terrible spark of Tormach inside it. This weapon is a 
Tormach’s blessed weapon
 (see chapter 4).

Doom Boar
“More vicious than a normal boar, the bite of the two-headed 
doom boar grants great unluck to those who survive it.”
Ill-Tempered
. The two-headed doom boars hate all life 
and vent their anger on any creature they can find. The 
mere sight of a creature drives them into a murderous 
rage as they try to tear their victim to shreds.
Unlucky Wounds
. The tusks of a doom boar cause 
grievous wounds carrying a random malediction lasting 
from a minute to a day.
Bone Collectors
. Doom boars find shelter in caves, 
under trees, or in hollows, but one sure sign of a doom 
boar’s lair is the smell of rot and the carpet of bones that 
liter the area. Doom boars frequently take trophies from 
their victims that rot in their lair, leaving bones behind.
salvage
The tusks of a doom boar can be harvested and made into a 
powder. The powder can be brewed into a tea with 75 gp of 
rare herbs that if drunk within an hour of its creation allows 
the victim of a curse another saving throw against a curse 
currently affecting them. The tea has no affect against a 
curse that does not allow a saving throw.
Additionally, eight doom boars’ worth of powder can 
be alchemically crafted into an elixir known as 
hogs’ wash 
(see Chapter 4)
by a creature with proficiency in alchemist’s 
supplies, spending 24 hours and 500 gp worth of rare 
herbs and succeeding a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check.

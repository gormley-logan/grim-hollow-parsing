Shadowsteel Ghoul
“Shards of dark metal pierce the skin of the foul 
creature. The metal pushes out from within the 
abomination rather than the other way.”
Shadowsteel Toxicity.
 Cursing an enemy requires an 
enormous amount of work and personal power. However, 
these efforts are for naught without the inclusion of the 
forbidden metal known as Shadowsteel. The frequent use 
of Shadowsteel takes its toll upon the mage handling it. 
In using it, the mage binds their soul, a bit at a time, to the 
energies of the fell metal. Those who use Shadowsteel can 
end up feeling its effects even after death.
Cold Afterlife
. Sometime between a week and a year 
after a mage steeped in the use of Shadowsteel dies, 
their body rises, reinforced with shards of the metal. A 
Shadowsteel ghoul is no flesh-eater, but it resembles a 
ghoul with its gangly limbs and hairless, hunched body. 
Undeath has given the Shadowsteel ghoul a cruel nature 
and a strong desire to infect living creatures with the 
curses it carries. A Shadowsteel ghoul instinctively seeks 
out carriers of Shadowsteel, hoping to consume their 
supply of the substance.
Ghast Form
. Once a Shadowsteel ghoul has amassed 
and absorbed enough Shadowsteel, the creature’s phys-
iology changes. The cursed metal brings back memories 
and mental acuity, allowing the fallen mage to reclaim 
some of their arcane power. The Shadowsteel shards 
embedded in the ghast’s skin grow, forming gleaming 
plates. A miasma follows the creature, an extension 
of their magic resistance, diminishing the resistances of 
others around the ghast. More potent curses are transmitted 
through the ghast’s claws.

salvage
Firearms recovered from skeleton troopers are nonfunc-
tional, but parts of them might be useful. Each firearm 
recovered can reduce the cost of making a similar firearm 
by 10%, up to 50%.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion):
 Necromancers 
with advanced training and hefty resources can make 
skeletons that are linked in death to their firearms.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 A commander leads 
some platoons of skeleton troopers. This skeleton directs the 
attacks and enhances the efficiency of its undead underlings.
GM Advice:
Skeletal troopers are effective when used as 
minions in the army of a higher-level threat. Cinematic 
battles focused on sieges or large battles are perfect for 
troopers. In these cases, having the troopers immune to 
turning until their powerful leader is defeated prevents 
anticlimactic encounters.

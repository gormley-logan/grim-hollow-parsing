Potbelly
“Our invader does nothing but laugh at our pain. 
Someone, anyone, save our little town!”
Cursed Giant.
 A potbelly is a giant cursed by unseelie 
fey. What remains is the mockery of a giant filled with 
the desire to cook and consume other living beings. The 
giant’s name comes from its new appearance. A cauldron 
hangs in the giant’s abdomen. It contains a bizarre boiling 
oil, and the potbelly can use this vessel to cook foes.
Gleeful Mayhem.
 A potbelly always smiles and joyfully 
goes about murdering and cooking other creatures. It 
happily snacks on fried corpses from its belly pot while 
crushing other foes. Even at the edge of death, a potbelly 
keeps up this twisted good cheer.
salvage
The cooking fluid in a potbelly’s cauldron cools and 
evaporates quickly after the potbelly dies. Someone who 
has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies can preserve 
some of the fluid within 1 minute of the fey giant’s 
death. This sample can be used to create a 
sizzling serum
(see chapter 4). Brewing this serum takes 4 hours and 
reagents worth 50 gp, and it requires a successful DC 13 
Intelligence (Nature) check.

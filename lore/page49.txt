Candlelight Daemon
“A candlelight daemon remains for the duration 
of a cursed candle’s flame. That’s long enough 
for a host of sinister deeds.”
Candle Bound
. The candlelight daemon can be sum-
moned only by the lighting of a specially prepared candle, 
and then only at night. Once the candle is snuffed or 
burns out, the daemon must return to the Netherworld. 
But such daemons can do their job in a short time.
Despicable Cost.
 To create a candle to summon a 
candlelight daemon, a spellcaster must make a candle 
during the new moon using the rendered fat of one 
murderer, the ashes of three humanoids who burned 
alive, and the blood of thirteen cats. The caster must also 
expend a 6th-level spell slot.

The melted leavings of a candlelight daemon’s candle 
act as 
oil of sharpness
 against aberrations, celestials, fey, 
and fiends, as well as against the creature that created 
the candle.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion):
 Candlelight daemons 
return to the Netherworld if their candle goes out.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Candlelight daemons 
have immunities and resistances typical of fiends, in-
cluding immunity to poison and resistance to cold, fire, 
lightning, and nonmagical weapon attacks. The daemon is 
also resistant to magic and capable of countering spells.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A candlelight daemon 
is most effective in shadows or darkness, which allow 
the fiend to hide easily and bring its murderous talents 
to bear.

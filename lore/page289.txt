Rougaugh
“The rage of remembering its lost life quivers in the 
very spines of the great beast, and the evil intelligence 
that shines in its eyes can freeze your soul.”
Children of the Beast
. 
Rougaugh are mutated 
creatures that fell prey to the transformative powers 
of the Beast. These aberrations were once humanoids, 
but as they lay dying at the feet of the Beast, they were 
reborn into something out of a nightmare. They took a 
quadrupedal form, and their ribcages grew into vicious 
spines emerging from their backs. Yet their heads and 
faces still have a resemblance to their old selves.
Beasts of Destruction
. Rougaugh are created by the 
Beast for the sole purpose of destroying and pillaging 
heavily populated areas. Imbued with an unholy strength, 
rougaugh can use their head to batter down doors or 
their spines to tear flesh from bone. They do not eat their 
victims, as they lap up the blood to sustain themselves.
Filled with Rage. 
The intelligence that was once 
present within the rougaugh has been horribly twisted. 
With hatred and madness fueling its actions, a rougaugh 
destroys anything put before it, but it also knows when to 
retreat from a battle it cannot win, using tactics seemingly 
beyond such a bestial creature.
salvage
The rougaugh’s thick purple blood carries a powerful 
enhancement. Someone who gathers the blood from two 
rougaugh can create an 
oil of sharpness 
by a proficient 
alchemist who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) 
check. Crafting this item takes 16 hours and requires 400 gp 
of components.

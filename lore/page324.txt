Crimson Stallion
“This fanged horse with scaly red skin stretched 
across its frame has cloven hooves dripping with dark 
oil. Embedded chains hold a black saddle to its back.”
Infernal Mounts
. Created in the Netherworld, these 
steeds come into existence when a contract for a Gift 
of Liberating Freedom is signed. Like most fiends, the 
crimson stallion can be summoned by learning its true 
name. These true names are often revealed in dreams to 
worthy owners, usually as rewards to fiends or mortals 
who have sent many souls to hell. Crimson stallions are 
reluctantly bound into service and fulfill their contracts, 
but rarely bond with their creators.
Ritual
. Once a true name is discovered, a spellcaster 
with at least one 4th-level spell slot can summon a 
crimson stallion in a 
magic circle
 drawn using the 
summoner’s blood and materials worth 5,000 gp, which 
the ritual consumes. The bond is completed when the 
summoner attaches a bridle made of humanoid sinew 
and chains to the fiend.
salvage
A crimson stallion ignites upon death, burning the body 
to ash within seconds, leaving only the hooves. Each of 
these can be ground into a powder and used to create 
a vial of alchemist’s fire. Doing so requires proficiency 
with alchemist’s supplies, a successful DC 10 Intelligence 
check, and 2 hours of work per vial.

Harvester of Lies
“Don’t lie to me, or the harvester will steal your tongue!”
Lie Detectors
. Infamous liars sometimes return as 
harvesters of lies after they die. These undead beings are 
capable of unerringly detecting falsehoods. The more lies 
one tells, the more attractive the liar’s tongue becomes to 
the harvester.
Macabre Collection
. The harvester of lies is compelled to 
collect the tongues of liars and sew them into a long coat that 
it wears. This coat is the creature’s most prized possession 
and without it, it cannot use its innate spellcasting.
Skulker
. Harvesters of lies are stealthy hunters that slip 
into their target’s home, harvest the victim’s tongue, and 
leave without alerting others. The harvester appears as 
a normal humanoid, but its skin is mottled and purple, 
and its eyes sunken and glaring.
salvage

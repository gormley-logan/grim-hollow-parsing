Tar Creep
“The slithering thing stank of pitch. It said not a word 
as it drowned your father within its slick skin.”
Elemental Hate.
 A tar creep is a toxic, volatile 
elemental that slithers into the material world to sow 
destruction. The creature doesn’t speak, but it looses 
chuckling gurgles as it kills, and it gyrates in mockery of 
the pain and anger of others. Each kill emboldens the tar 
creep more.
Pitch Dwellers.
 In bubbling tar pits or where oily 
sludge flows, tar creeps lurk. A tar creep seeks such 
areas of comfort, moving about only when forced to, 
destroying all life in its path. If such life comes close to 
a creep’s sanctuary, it slips out, slyly at first, until it gets 
close enough to strike. Then, the creep rises in roughly 
humanoid form and engulfs its prey.

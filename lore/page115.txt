Claunt Mamona
“We’re out of stock on that particular item. If you don’t 
mind who you do business with, there’s a pigheaded 
merchant in the market right now who claims to have 
anything a body could want.”
Cursed Merchant
. Once a successful merchant in 
Morencia, Claunt was cursed to a porcine form by a 
powerful sorcerer for steeply raising the prices of staple 
foods during a famine. In the years since, one business 
venture after another failed as partners ended contracts 
with him out of an abundance of superstitious caution. 
Though not destitute, he lived far beneath the means he 
once enjoyed and became desperate to reverse his fortune.
Friends in Low Places
. To that end, Claunt took to 
worshipping Gorodyn. After a particularly bad falling 
out with a previous business partner, Claunt made a 
terrible sacrifice to the Arch Daemon of Avarice and was 
rewarded with a 
satchel of sorcerous sale
. With supply no 
longer an issue, and hoping to escape the consequences 
of the sacrifice, Claunt began traveling to sell his wares. 
It wasn’t long before he discovered that even individual 
buyers wanted little to do with someone in his condition.
Open for Business
. Now more distraught than ever, 
Claunt is most likely to be encountered on the road or 
the outskirts of major settlements, living on whatever 
meager sales he can make. He happily travels with any 
player characters agreeing to purchase his goods on 
an ongoing basis. If Claunt believes he can mentor (or 
exploit) a particularly charismatic player character, he 
offers to provide them with supplies if they serve as the 
face of his business. If he believes the player characters 
as a group are capable, he asks their help in tracking 
down and slaying the sorcerer who cursed him.

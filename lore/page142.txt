Grinstagger wears a 
ring of mind shielding
, which he keeps 
invisible. It becomes visible if he dies. When that happens, 
his soul enters the ring. While his soul is in the ring, he can 
telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. 
A wearer can’t prevent this communication.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Grinstagger is a mighty 
oni cursed for breaking his pact with an archfey.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 The curse twisted 
Grinstagger’s flesh when he used his arcane powers. He 
escaped the curse, but its previous effects remain, giving 
Grinstagger his unique appearance.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Grinstagger retains the 
power he stole from his patron. He can curse others with 
his attacks.
GM Advice:
 Grinstagger is a powerful being, and his goals 
are always power and survival. When it becomes clear that 
a foe is more powerful than he is, he’ll make every effort to 
promise wealth and power in exchange for his life. Whether 
he can deliver on those promises is another story altogether.
Grinstagger generally travels and lairs with minions who 
serve him until he no longer has a use for him. With the fey 
powers pursuing Grinstagger relentlessly, his minions are 
generally kept around as a buffer between the oni and his 
pursuers, and don’t last long.
If the characters make a deal with Grinstagger to gain his 
knowledge or assistance, they quickly come to learn that 
Grinstagger has many powerful enemies who attack frequently.

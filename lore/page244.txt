Oozing Vulture
“The squawking and flapping of wings didn’t cause me 
to flee. The blood-dripping feathers and gnarled beak? 
A whole different story.”
Oozing Feathers
. Oozing vultures appear as avian 
creatures with red-tinged feathers that drip blood 
when they’re hunting. This blood often attracts other 
predators, which the oozing vulture attacks when they 
approach expecting an easy meal.
Attracted to Blood
. The oozing vulture can smell an 
open wound over great distances, and the smell of blood 
causes it to slip into a ravenous frenzy.
Semi-Social
. While oozing vultures are frequently 
found in groups, their blood frenzy keeps them from 
working together as a flock like other avian creatures. 
However, they might enter symbiotic relationships with 
ground-dwelling creatures to maximize their hunting 
prospects. If caught and trained, oozing vultures can act 
as excellent guards or hunters.

Swarm of Ears
“I was minding my business, digging in the mines, 
and my ear ripped off my head and flew away!”
Obscure Omen.
 Ears heed the call, the hum, of the 
kokela. Those near but unaware of the kokela can 
lose their right ear. It rips off the head and flies away, 
heading for the kokela. This weird loss of ears is a sign 
of the end, an odd and obscure event that herald’s the 
kokela’s singing the final song.
Despicable Devotion.
 Swarms of ears are devoted to 
protecting the kokela and ensuring it can achieve its only 
purpose. These swarms attack anything that isn’t aiding 
the kokela, such as the chosen one and that individual’s 
allies. A swarm can sacrifice itself to keep the kokela alive. 
Swarms of ears might also be found roaming, performing 
some bizarre tasks only it and the kokela know.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with leatherworker’s 
tools can sew the still-living ears that remain after a 
swarm of ears disperses to create a 
cloak of the listener
(see chapter 4). If a swarm uses Sacrifice, no ears remain 
alive. Crafting the cloak takes 5 days and requires other 
materials worth 500 gp.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The swarm of ears is 
bizarre and might seem harmless, but it overwhelms with 
psychic dissonance and releases wax to hinder movement.
DC 20 Intelligence (History):
 This swarm can 
sacrifice itself to the kokela, healing that abomination.
DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana):
 As with the kokela, a 
deafened swarm is significantly weakened.

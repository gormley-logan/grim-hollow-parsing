A
Aberrant Horror
“Children sing nursery rhymes about suspicious 
strangers for a reason. Heed the tales and check them 
for tentacles before offering shelter.”
Abominable Experiment.
 In desperate times science 
and magic can progress by leaps and bounds, but 
such rapid advancement has its risks. Without proper 
precautions, experimenters or their subjects might be 
caught in forces beyond imagining and become twisted 
into something abominable. No two mishaps are alike, 
yet each of the misbegotten results is known as an 
aberrant horror.
Warped Flesh.
 Those who survive the uncontrolled 
transformation into aberrant horrors become living 
weapons. Some theories say the body sees the transmuting 
force as a threat and evolves defenses against it. Others 
believe that the accident triggers dormant bestial adapta-
tions from the distant past. Whatever the reason, aberrant 
horrors are vicious combatants, armed with hardened 
claws, venomous spines, and other strange adaptations.

Aberrant horrors have been saturated in eldritch energies. 
Each horror’s body can provide a number of material 
components for arcane necromancy or transmutation
spells equal to half the horror’s challenge challenge rating.
Each component is consumed when used to cast, but
the spell is cast as if the caster used a spell slot one level
higher, up to a maximum of a 5th-level slot.

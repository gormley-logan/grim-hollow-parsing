Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can take four lupilisk venom fangs, or just the two fangs 
of one lupilisk elder, and treat them with reagents worth 
250 gp per tooth for 3 days. A successful treatment 
requires the alchemist to succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence 
or Wisdom check. During the treatment time, somebody 
must also cast 
lesser restoration
 on the fangs. After a 
successful treatment, someone who has proficiency with 
jeweler’s tools can fashion the fangs, now blackened, into 
a necklace, creating a 
periapt of proof against poison
. If the 
wearer attunes to the periapt, the amulet also provides 
that wearer immunity to being petrified.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A lupilisk’s bite imparts 
a petrifying venom to prey. This magic toxin grows more 
potent as the lupilisk ages.
DC 15 Intelligence (History):
 Lupilisks live in packs 
with an elder couple in the lead. This couple are the 
parents of most other pack members.

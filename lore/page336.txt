The remains of a tar creep can be used as the main ingredient 
for alchemist’s fire. The remains of one tar creep provides 
enough pitch to cut the cost of making ten flasks of 
alchemist’s fire by 50%. A tar juggernaut provides enough 
material to cut the cost for twenty-five flasks.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana):
 Tar creeps are 
elementals with resistances to nonmagical damage and 
immunity to poison.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A tar creep isn’t 
vulnerable to fire, but it continues to burn if it ignites. 
This fire hurts the tar creep, but it can also ignite the 
elemental’s foes.
GM Advice:
 Ranged attacks might be important for more 
powerful monsters to have, especially if the powerful characters 
they oppose have a variety of ways to attack from a distance. The 
tar juggernaut’s Engulfing Charge may help in such cases, but 
other options can be helpful. If you find the tar juggernaut needs 
a ranged attack, consider the following:
Hurl Tar
.
Ranged Weapon Attack:
 +10 to hit, range 50/150 
ft., one target. 
Hit:
 22 (3d10 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the 
target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 
18). Until this grapple ends, the target makes ranged weapon or 
spell attacks with disadvantage.

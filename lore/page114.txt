Gillian Hammerstorm
“Her? Oh, she’s a regular here. Drinks until she 
gets into a fight, wins more often than not, then 
calls it a night. Sweet girl.”
Storm Break
. For over a thousand years the Hammer-
storm clan mined the Rock-Teeth Mountains to the east 
of Liesech. After the Weeping Pox swept through the city, 
it found its way to the Hammerstorm’s underground 
domain, where it decimated the clan. Less than five years 
later, only a handful of dwarves remained. The survivors 
realized they could not sustain their ancestral estates and 
dispersed to other lands. Gillian, the youngest surviving 
Hammerstorm, settled in Liesech.
Demon in a Bottle
. Since the dissolution of her clan, 
Gillian has taken to spending her inheritance drinking 
away her nights. She came to Liesech hopeful that she 
could earn a lasting heroic legacy for the Hammerstorm 
name, but the rampant cynicism and brutality of the city 
quickly wore her down—and she abandoned her dream. 
Quick to anger, Gillian has been kicked out of most 
reputable taverns in the city for starting fights, leaving 
her to exclusively patronize ale houses of lesser quality.
Last Call
. Player characters who accomplish a heroic 
and public act might catch Gillian’s attention, causing 
her to temporarily set aside her bitterness for the chance 
at redemption. In this circumstance, Gillian tracks the 
player characters down and asks to join their party. 
Otherwise, Gillian can be found at any of Liesech’s seedy 
taverns, and she eagerly joins any group of adventurers 
that pays her tab or helps her win a bar fight.

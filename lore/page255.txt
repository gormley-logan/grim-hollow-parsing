GM Advice:
 A parasitic blightworm infestation can be a 
devastating plot twist in a campaign. A trusted ally who falls prey 
to one can do irreparable harm to the characters. If this happens, 
give the characters subtle hints that their ally is acting differently, 
without stating it outright. The players will feel great if they figure 
it out based on your subtle clues, and they can solve the problem 
before it gets too far out of hand.

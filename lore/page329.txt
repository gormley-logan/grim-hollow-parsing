Suture 
Golem
“Just because it’s made to gather corpses 
doesn’t mean it can’t harm the living.”
Corpse Seeker.
 Gathering corpses for necromantic 
rituals is difficult, dirty work. Powerful arcanists delegate 
that work to constructs. Suture golems are that sort of 
construct, made to bring corpses back to their masters. 
If corpses are hard to find, the golem can make them.
Wire Body.
 A suture golem is a hulking mass of flesh 
and tough wire. The magic imbued in the construct allows 
it to use its filaments as limbs. These entangling threads 
work well to grab and hold those the golem intends to 
return to its master.

Someone who has proficiency with weaver’s tools can 
use the wire from one suture golem to make a 
living net
(see chapter 4). Doing so takes 3 days of work and 
other materials worth 100 gp. Someone must cast 
hold 
person
 on the net each day of its crafting.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History):
 Suture golems are 
constructed of body parts and wires. Necromancers use 
them to collect corpses. However, the golem can use its 
abilities to entangle and restrain living beings.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 A suture golem is 
immune to nonmagical weapon attacks. However, ada-
mantine weapons can harm it, as can slashing weapons, 
although adamantine or magic slashing weapons are 
more effective. The golem’s attacks are magical.

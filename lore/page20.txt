Disease is no stranger to the people of Etharis. The vir-
ulent Weeping Pox has devastated towns and families, 
and the Tears of the Hungerer is rumored to be a poison 
designed by necromancers. Other afflictions, such as 
the Seven Shades of Sitri and the Faith Cough, are not 
deadly but can impede even the strongest body. These 
diseases can be carried by animals, breaking their normal 
method of transmission. A twist of nature or foul magic 
has created carriers, some intentionally and some aggres-
sively, that spread sickness quickly.
Faith Finch.
 Seeing a silver faith finch is considered 
a sign of good luck. If one of these friendly birds lands 
on a shoulder or hand, it can be thought of as a blessing 
from the Divine Arch Seraphs. But some of these birds 
carry and spread the Faith Cough.
Pox Dog.
 Oozing lesions cover a pox dog’s body, matting 
its fur. Pus runs from its eyes. Lack of hydration has 
receded its gums. Pox dogs attack other creatures on sight 
and form packs, seeking blood to slake their thirst. They 
are harder to kill than appearances might make it seem.
Sitri Cat.
 If a cat is hardier and more aggressive than 
a regular cat, it might carry the disease called Seven 
Shades of Sitri. Such cats otherwise show no signs of 
illness. A rub against the leg, a pet on the head, or a claw 
can all transmit the sickness.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with leatherworker’s tools 
can fashion the hides of ten pox dogs into leather armor, 
studded leather armor, or hide armor. Leather and hide 
require 8 days of work and extra materials worth 50 gp, 
while studded leather requires 10 days and 100 gp. 
Somebody must cast lesser restoration on the armor at 
least once during the process. A creature wearing the 
armor has advantage on saving throws against disease.
Additionally, the beautiful silver feathers of a faith 
finch can fetch 5 gp per finch from a costume maker or 
other clothier.

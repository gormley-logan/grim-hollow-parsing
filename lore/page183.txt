Rumors in ancient texts have it that planting the Laethlynâ€™s 
heart in soil that has never been trodden upon by mortal 
foot and watering it daily for 30 days will grow a single 
sapling of great power. Any druid that subsequently 
expends 10 spell slots of 4th level or higher on the living 
sapling can magically shape it into a
 staff of the woodlands
.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (History)
: The old forests are 
sometimes protected by powerful fey like the Laethlyn, 
and travelers who enter without permission are often 
never heard from again.
DC 15 Intelligence (Nature)
: Magical plants like 
thunderblossoms and lightning vines are sometimes 
grown by the fey as a form of defense against intrusions 
into their domain.
DC 15 Wisdom (Animal Handling)
: Intelligent beasts 
are often companions of druids and fey creatures, which 
sometimes awaken them fully into sentient beings. The 
Laethlyn surrounds themselves with such creatures.
DC 20 Intelligence (Nature or History)
: The 
Laethlyn has lived for centuries and has destroyed 
more than a few mortals, celestials, and fiends who 
sought their fealty.
DC 25 Intelligence (Nature)
: The Laethlyn supposedly 
knows where to find nature artifacts of great power that 
were hidden in their woods long ago. What properties 
these artifacts have is something only they know.

Lindwyrm
“My great grandfather spoke of the lindwyrm terrorizing 
the countryside and devouring whole villages. But it’s 
been so long since anyone has seen the beast, it’s likely the 
creature is long dead. Thank Miklas!”
Century’s Sleep
. After a few months of gorging itself, a 
lindwyrm burrows deep into its underground lair where 
it slumbers, only stirring if something disturbs it. But in 
another hundred years, its hunger wakens it again.
Adventurous Eater
. Lindwyrms are voracious eaters, con-
suming all manner of crops, livestock, and people. If it can 
swallow it, it does, and lindwyrms have very big mouths.
Burrowing Terror
. With their long serpentine bodies 
and two large claws, lindwyrms can burrow nearly as 
fast as they can run above ground. Tremors can be a sign 
of an approaching lindwyrm.
salvage
A dose of 
lindwyrm venom
 (see Chapter 4) can be harvested 
by someone proficient with a poisoner’s kit and succeeds 
on a DC 18 Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, but this 
must be done within 1 hour of the lindwyrm’s death. If 
the check fails by 5 or more, the harvester instead poisons 
themselves. This injury poison is worth 1,000 gp.

GM Advice:
 One exciting adventure seed could find a powerful 
enemy of the adventurers looking to waken and control a 
lindwyrm. Whether that plot succeeds or not is up to you, but a 
three-way battle between involving a lindwyrm and other foes 
should be memorable as the action ebbs and flows.

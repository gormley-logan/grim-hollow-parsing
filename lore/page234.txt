Nether Spider
“As the venom of the large black-and-red spider acts, 
the victim disintegrates into smoking ashes.”
Nether Arachnids.
 A mix of black and fiery red, these 
large spiders glow with infernal heat. Fiends spawn 
nether spiders in the Netherworld to patrol and defend 
strongholds. They slip into Etharis to hunt for fresh prey, 
which they reduce to ashy sludge to drink.
Light-Absorbing Webs.
 The webs of a nether spider 
are resistant to flame, and they absorb light, making a 
nether spider lair extremely dark.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies or 
cook’s utensils can prepare the venom glands of a nether 
spider with spices worth 10 gp to create a soup equivalent 
to two flasks of alchemist’s fire. Doing so requires 4 hours 
of work and a successful DC 13 Intelligence or Wisdom 
check. Failure by 5 or more on this check causes the soup 
to ignite before it can be bottled.

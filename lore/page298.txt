Seraph Servants
“With the gods of Etharis gone, the Arch Seraphs and their 
servants have fought to cling to their individual purposes. 
Some of those celestials have even changed themselves to 
suit their new roles.”
Specialized Skills
. These servants of the Arch 
Seraphs have morphed themselves to fit the needs of 
their leaders and the tasks on which they’re sent. Some 
have taken their focus to extremes.
Not Fallen, Just Different
. Some Seraph servants 
barely resemble what they once were. And yet their 
essence remains intact, even when they may have lost 
their immortality and other celestial traits.

Anyone who manages to collect five eyes of Zabriel can 
ingest all five at the rate of one per round. At the end 
of the fifth round, if the ingester succeeds on a DC 10 
Wisdom (Insight) check, they can cast the 
augury
 spell. 
They need not ordinarily be able to cast the spell or to 
have any other material components to cast the spell in 
this manner. 
The wings that sprout from an Empyrean knight’s 
back look like they’re made from swords, in homage to 
the Arch Seraph they serve. Someone can attempt to 
attach the wings to their back as an action with a success-
ful DC 15 Strength (Religion) check. On a success, the 
wearer can fly as per the 
fly
 spell for 10 minutes.
The bloodied are a strange occurrence, and their chains 
are a powerful magical ward. Someone succeeding on a 
DC 15 Wisdom (Arcana) check can attach them to their 
body for a brief time. On a success, the chains provide life 
protection as per the 
death ward
 spell for 1 hour.

Toymaker
“Good little children get to sleep through the night. Bad 
little children get a visit from the toymaker.”
Evil Hunter of the Naughty.
 Dark, cold nights 
bring out a hunter with a keen eye for wrongdoers. 
The creature known as the toymaker scouts settlements, 
searching for people with dark secrets. Such a person 
gets a nocturnal visit, leaving their household a bloody 
graveyard. The toymaker targets those who have 
committed terrible acts, but it has no qualms attacking 
anyone standing in the way.
A Sight of Blood and Bone.
 The toymaker is a 
hunched, skinless humanoid with bone poking through 
bare muscle. It has a grinning face covered in a white 
“beard” of boney spines. When the toymaker is angry or 
excited, its grin grows wider, and its beard chitters as the 
spines click together. However, it can also appear as a 
white-haired human with a jolly countenance, especially 
when creating its toys.
Footsteps on the Roof.
 The toymaker enters houses 
by nontraditional means, such as the attic or chimney. 
When people know a toymaker is about, they block their 
windows and keep fires burning through the night. In 
addition to its unusual entrance habits, the toymaker 
rarely leaves tracks.
Bag of Toys.
 The toymaker stuffs victims in a great 
leather bag. Back in its lair, the toymaker puts survivors 
to work making “toys” out of remnants of other victims. 
These survivors work this way until they escape or die. 
Someone who can no longer make toys becomes a toy.

This can be made into a 
bag of holding
, but it must be 
refined from its previous macabre use. Someone who has

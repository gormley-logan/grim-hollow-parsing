The Fractured
“Those brutal murders could only be the work of a true 
monster. I’m sure that mild-mannered investigator who 
was interviewing witnesses will catch the beast.”
Buried Rage.
 On the surface, those known as the 
fractured seem no different than any other member of 
society. They adhere to rules of conduct and go about 
their business as usual when in public, but this behavior 
is a façade. When given free reign, they transform into 
swollen creatures of limitless rage.
Mask of Civility.
 The fractured avoid revealing their 
true nature. Keeping their identity hidden is one of their 
primary goals, so they retreat to an isolated area before 
transforming. Once changed, they seek to eliminate 
witnesses and flee only as a last resort.

Fractured people carry items normal for their public 
persona. Many craft this persona to be as unlike their true, 
enraged form as possible. As a result, they often possess 
objects of delicate or expensive craftsmanship, such as silk 
handkerchiefs, fine clothing, or jewelry. Clothing seldom 
survives the fractured person’s rage intact.

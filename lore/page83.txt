The fabric of a defeated death cap is very valuable to 
tailors and creators of magical clothing, fetching 250 gp. 
Creating a magical cloak, hat, or other clothing using the 
fabric from a death cap cuts the creation time in half.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion): 
Placing the death 
cap on one’s head opens one up to possession by the 
malignant undead. Once a death cap takes control, it 
pushes its host to murderous carnage. While one can 
cut down the host, the easiest way to rid a possessed 
creature of the cap is to turn undead.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The death cap rides 
roughshod over its host, not only pushing it into battle but 
also denying it sustenance and sleep. Worst still, it slowly 
devours those it possesses. The cap can be forced off a 
host’s body by using 
dispel evil and good
 or similar magic.
Other Slayers
While a cap appears to be the favored form of these horrid 
creatures, stories abound about other forms, from cloaks 
that seem more patient than the cap form to gauntlets or 
even weapons, more interested in political power than pure 
slaughter. These different types of death caps keep their 
host around for extended periods, sometimes even years, 
which means the death cap either doesn’t feed on the host 
or keeps them alive with some form of necromancy.
Some necromancers and priests educated in the dark 
arts either scoff at such tales or warn that the cap form 
might be a lesser form of this item-haunting undead.

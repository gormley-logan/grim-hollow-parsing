Malefic Broker
“The sound of coins clanking together is music to the ears of 
some. In the hands of a malefic broker, it’s a death knell.”
Disciples of Gorodyn.
 A rare fiend, the malefic broker 
is an example of a diabolic middleman. Taking the form of a 
humanoid, the malefic broker hones its skills in negotiation 
and acquisition rather than its fiendish might. Greed 
motivates a malefic broker, who scrambles to acquire more 
souls for Gorodyn through deception and persuasion.
Soul Shards.
 Despite a disdain for mortal wealth, 
a malefic broker carries gems, which the fiend uses to 
siphon pieces of souls fleeing the dying. When cornered, 
a malefic broker consumes these soul shards to gain 
eldritch might it can use to defend itself.
salvage
Soul shards taken from the malefic broker fetch 250 gp 
each, or more, from rich collectors and arcanists. If crushed, 
added to water, and imbibed, each soul shard acts as a 
potion of superior healing
. A malefic broker carries jewels 
worth at least 500 gp to turn into more soul shards.
lore
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 Malefic brokers collect 
souls, either through fiendish contracts or being near 
those who die. The soul shards they carry can power 
their fiendish abilities.

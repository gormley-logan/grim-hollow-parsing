Runa Banasár
“Pull up a chair and hear the story of Runa Banasár. She 
proved that with enough willpower, you can overcome 
the cold of death as easily as the cold of the North.”
Revered Leader.
 Runa Banasár was the leader of a 
northern tribe in time long forgotten. She lived for the thrill 
of the hunt, and her rare skills kept her clan fed for many 
years. Runa grew bored hunting wild game and left her 
home many times, exploring farther and farther to find 
bigger challenges. She returned home months or years later 
with the trophies from countless monsters and beasts.
Path to Undeath.
 During her travels, Runa learned 
the ritual to become a memori lich. She feared aging and 
death. To become immortal and avoid frailty, Runa was 
willing to do whatever was required. She eventually 
slaughtered her clan to become a lich and maintain that 
status. Runa still travels the world, looking for fierce 
enemies and souls to maintain her undeath.

raw value or to collectors.

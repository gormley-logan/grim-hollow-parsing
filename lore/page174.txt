jespaith
“When the ground becomes corrupted with violence and 
sin, it rises into a great stain of hate and brutality. Cloying 
with corruption, this jangle of stone and bones chews up the 
land and seeks to destroy living creatures in the area.”
Manifested Corruption
. Rising from corrupted earth 
like a tornado of blight and decay, a jespaith is a haze of 
poison swirling around the fossilized bones of ancient 
horrors. The buzzing, clanking mess seethes across the 
landscape, then burrows under the earth, only to reach 
up again to sow destruction. It moves like a strange, 
clawed serpent, sometimes splitting into tails and 
sections to reach its prey.

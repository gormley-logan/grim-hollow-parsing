Poffer
“You see these fellas in the wild and think, ‘aw, look at them sheep 
with cute bushy wool!’ But step closer and they’ll fall upon you 
like a storm, and where there’s storms, there’s lightning.”
Rambunctious Ruminants.
 Poffers are sheeplike 
creatures named after the typical poffer’s bushy woolen 
coat. Alone, a poffer is docile and can make a nice, low-
maintenance pet. But flocks of poffers are aggressive, 
charging other creatures that come too close.
Worthwhile Wool.
 Ranching poffers is worth the 
risk. Although a flock of poffers can be dangerous, 
their wool is insulating in multiple ways. It can make 
warm, comfortable clothing that also protects the 
wearer from shocks.
salvage
People prize poffer wool for its insulating properties. 
Someone who has proficiency with weaver’s tools can 
use the wool of five poffers to make one 
suit of the lamb
(see chapter 4). Creating the suit takes 3 days.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Nature):
 Multiple poffers in 
proximity to another creature can cause an incapacitating 
shock. The creatures are aggressive in flocks, and they 
trample fallen foes.

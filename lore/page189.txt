The severed head of a lenchtahg is a potent magic object. 
To the right buyer—a necromancer, a daemon cultist, an 
evil alchemist, and the like—a lenchtahg head is worth 
750 gp. The servants of the Arch Daemon Malikir guard 
the secrets of binding a lenchtahg, but hags and other 
wicked creatures with magical skills possess knowledge 
to convert a lenchtahg head into a construct with similar 
unholy power.
lore
DC 10 Intelligence (Religion):
 Radiant damage heals 
a lenchtahg, which still has the flesh of a Seraph.
DC 15 Intelligence (Religion):
 Dowsing a Lenchtahg 
with a lot of water or any holy water can temporarily 
weaken it.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana):
 The lenchtahg’s head 
must be consecrated in a holy ceremony or otherwise 
rid of its evil to avoid the lenchtahg’s rejuvenation. But 
those with the right knowledge can use the head to craft 
a magical servitor.
GM Advice:
 Those who use lenchtahg as troops in battle 
will use radiant magic to damage foes while at the same 
time healing the lenchtahg. This greatly heightens the 
strength of these monsters.

Sand Giants
“At least if you die in a sandstorm, you don’t end up spending 
your time in chains, serving the whims of wicked giants.”
Wasteland Masters.
 Sand giants live in nomadic 
tribes, each ruled by a monarch and spiritual leaders 
dubbed callers. They scavenge materials from anything 
left in the desert, and they rob and hunt as they move 
from one oasis to the next. Sand giant raiders rarely kill 
creatures the giants can force to labor for the tribe. But 
death might be preferable to servitude in the wastelands.
Hearty Navigators.
 Born into the lands of shifting 
dunes, sandstorms, and unforgiving temperature 
extremes, sand giants have adapted to survive. They 
navigate with all their senses and rarely become lost. 
A lifetime of crossing shifting dunes makes sand giants 
nimble in rough terrain. Sand giants can also go for 
long periods without food and water, and their skin is 
conditioned to natural heat and cold.
Traveled Traders.
 Sand giants travel far to pursue 
trade. They respect the laws of the lands they journey in, 
but they believe they are entitled to anything they can 
win through might and skill. A sand giant avoids costly 
battles, however, whether the price is being banned from 
a trading hub or death at the hands of a stronger foe.
salvage
Sand giants value shows of wealth, and they carry their 
belongings in ornate packs. Every sand giant has valuable 
personal effects worth at least 100 gp in their packs.
Sand giants are also expert cartographers, carrying 
detailed maps of the areas that they travel. A sand giant 
monarch carries maps worth up to 500 gp. Some might be 
more valuable to anyone interested in mapmaking, trade, 
or travel. One or more of these maps might show locations 
of potential treasure, such as ancient ruins in the desert.

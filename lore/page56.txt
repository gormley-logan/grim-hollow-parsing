Someone who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can 
prepare a treatment for cauchemange larva infestation 
by pulverizing another larva’s corpse with herbs worth 
25 gp. Creating the concoction takes 1 hour of work and 
a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check. If someone 
infected by a cauchemange larva takes the treatment, they 
throw off the infection with a successful DC 10 Constitution 
saving throw. This cure kills the larva.
Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s 
supplies can use powder from the corpse of one corporeal 
cauchemange with other materials worth 100 gp to produce 
a divination drug. Doing so takes 4 hours of work and 
requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence (Arcana) check. 
Inhaled while naming a subject before a long rest, the drug 
induces a nightmare-filled sleep that imparts the effect of 
the 
legend lore
 spell on the named subject. The user wakes 
with desired information but one level of exhaustion.
lore
DC 10
Wisdom (Medicine):
 The larval form of a 
cauchemange can burrow into you and pupate within 
your body, bursting out after a few days as an adult that 
resembles your worst nightmare. This infection can be 
treated much like a disease.
DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana):
 An adult cauchemange 
can cause magical fear, and a corporeal cauchemange 
can appear as someone or something you desire. They 
have a peculiar weakness to expressions of happiness. 
Singing songs or reciting stories of hope can debilitate 
the creatures.
GM Advice:
 An enemy to the heroes might implant 
a cauchemange larva into a character or NPC at an 
opportune moment. They could then use the psychic data 
gained by the larva to forward their own evils plans.

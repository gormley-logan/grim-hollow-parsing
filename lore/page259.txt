GM Advice:
 For maximum surprise and effectiveness in 
challenging the characters, plague doctors are best used when 
the characters trust them. Perhaps the characters are relying on a 
doctor to help them in a situation where diseases are ravaging an 
area. A plague doctor is as likely to kill a character suffering from 
a disease (in the name of medicine, of course) than heal them.

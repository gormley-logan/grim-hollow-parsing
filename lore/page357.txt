Wechselkind
“Where the fey tread, trouble follows. And there’s no 
clearer evidence of fey activity than a wechselkind.”
Living Dolls.
 They sometimes magically disguise 
themselves as flesh and blood children, but wechselkinds 
are living dolls constructed from clay, wood, and fey 
enchantments. Each wechselkind is created by a fey 
planning to steal a humanoid child to take back to the fey 
realms. Wechselkinds are unwitting pawns in such plans 
and, after fulfilling their role in the scheme, remain in the 
mortal world, abandoned.
No Strings.
 Despite their origins, wechselkinds are 
neither fey spies nor passionless constructs. Magic 
that animates wechselkinds grants them true sapience. 
Despite this capacity for free will, wechselkinds suffer 
fear and suspicion from other people. Without a place in 
the world, and with the rarity of wechselkinds meaning 
they rarely form groups, these living dolls must survive 
by their wits.
Wechselkinds live on society’s outskirts. With honest 
work hard to come by, they can take up a life of petty 
crime. Others call on fey magic to weave compelling 
illusions and intoxicating enchantments. This connection 
to the fey realms serves some wechselkinds well. But 
other wechselkinds distance themselves from their fey 
origins and, thereby, other wechselkinds willing to use 
fey magic.
Etharis can be an unkind place, particularly to 
wechselkinds. Some turn to evil, including plague cults 
that seek to cull or purge other humanoids. The tenets 
and goals of every plague cult differ, but such cultists 
carry diseased detritus to infect their targets.

Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s supplies 
can treat a deceased wechselkind’s clay heart with 
reagents worth 50 gp. The heart can then be fired into a 
glassy substance, and someone who has proficiency with 
jeweler’s tools or tinker’s tools can shape that glass into a 
needle. The whole process takes 8 hours, and both

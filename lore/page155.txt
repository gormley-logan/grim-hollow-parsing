Hivewolf
“Trust me when I say this: there’s no 
such thing as one hivewolf.”
Monstrous Hybrids.
 Hivewolves are a combination 
of ant and wolf. Covered in chitinous plates, with toothy 
jaws flanked by sharp mandibles, these monstrosities strip 
areas of animals and plants to feed their voracious hunger.
Hivemind.
 Their insectile nature allows hivewolves to 
remain in contact in a way much like telepathy. If one 
hivewolf or pack encounters a tough foe, others quickly 
come to aid their allies.
Queen’s Servants.
 When moving to a new area, 
hivewolves establish a nest for their matriarch. From 
there, multiple packs set out to find and secure food for 
the bloated queen. If left unchecked, the queen produces 
enough progeny to threaten a whole region.
salvage
Someone who has proficiency with smith’s tools can 
fashion a hivewolf matriarch’s mandibles into a 
caustic 
rapier
 (see chapter 4). Doing so takes 5 days of work and 
materials worth 200 gp. Somebody needs to cast 
acid arrow
on the weapon once during its crafting or 
acid splash
 on it 
every day during its creation.

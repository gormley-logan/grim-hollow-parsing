Hag-Blighted
“We warned Marta she was tempting the fates by 
seeking out Old Zsuzsa Blackwart. You never know 
what might anger a hag.”
Hag Victim.
 Deceiving and manipulative, hags are 
prone to cursing mortals for anything from breaking a 
bargain to mere amusement. Hag-blighted beings are 
unfortunate souls who’ve angered a hag. Instead of 
slaying the person, the hag chooses a crueler fate and 
uses a hag-blight curse.
Cursed Form.
 Under a hag-blight curse, a victim’s 
form becomes monstrous. The person’s face becomes 
a permanent scowl and grows warts and pustules, 
and their teeth become fangs. Their body bloats, and 
the limbs twist. Despite these changes, the body is 
powerful and enduring.
Social Pariah.
 Most people shun the hag-blighted for 
fear of the hag’s ire. Only the brave or foolish dare seek 
out the hag to remove this affliction.
salvage
The blood of a dead hag-blighted person can be used to 
make a potion that ends any effect that changes a creature’s 
shape. Someone who has proficiency with alchemist’s 
supplies can distill the blood from one hag-blighted, along 
with reagents worth 50 gp, to make three doses of this potion 
in 4 hours. Doing so requires a successful DC 13 Intelligence 
or Wisdom check. This potion can be consumed, or it can 
be thrown as an improvised weapon, making a ranged 
attack against a creature. A creature exposed to this potion 
can’t change shape for 10 minutes, while a creature who 
drinks the potion can’t change shape for 1 hour.

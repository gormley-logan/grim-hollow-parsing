DC 15 Intelligence (History): Any suspected arcanist

or associate of a suspected mage who publicly declares

allegiance to Empyreus and confesses to crimes against

the divine order can request judgment from a speaker for

the Arch Seraph. If they do so, inquisitors are obligated

to take the individual to the Cathedral of Embers for

trial rather than passing judgment and meting out

punishment as they normally would.

DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana): The Cathedral of Embers,

headquarters of the Arcanist Inquisition, is a well-known

prison for suspected arcanists awaiting trial or serving

a sentence. Less known is that the complex also contains

an enormous collection of magic items, kept locked away.

The inquisition is concerned as much with keeping the

items safe as sequestering their potential inﬂuence.

DC 20 Intelligence (Religion): Trained to root out

secrets, some inquisitors have special blessings that

allow them to pierce illusions and uncover deceit.

Their devotion leads them to pursue their foes despite

personal risk, making them difﬁcult to evade.

      There’s no denying the varied and terrible methods that

        the innocent sheep. The only force standing between
       the population and vile arcanists are us. Striking down
       the users of magic is one step in our plan, but we also

                  Bugbears

       “Tormach subverted bugbears with a disease that
        makes them little more than killing machines.”

Tormach’s Rage. The bugbears of Etharis weren’t
always ferocious and violent. When the Arch Daemons
appeared in the world, Tormach believed he could make
minions of the goblinoids. Bugbear warriors forcefully
opposed his efforts to subvert goblin tribes to his will.
Tormach commanded his servants to craft a disease that
would render deﬁant bugbears into vicious drones, a
grim task those minions completed with great success.
Tormach’s Rage, as the disease has come to be known,
spread quickly. Most bugbears of Etharis are now
victims of this mind-altering plague.
   The disease causes a bugbear to become more resilient
while increasing muscle mass and capacity for aggression.
Bugbears infected with Tormach’s Rage experience a
powerful, instinctive urge to spread their illness. Infected
bugbears have enhanced olfactory senses that allow them
to smell whether a creature carries Tormach’s Rage. When
they discover a bugbear without the disease, they ﬂy into
a frenzy. The sickness is virulent enough that even if a
bugbear survives the ﬁght or kills the infected aggressor,
it’s unlikely to do so without contracting Tormach’s Rage.

Staged Changes. Rage-infected bugbears have only
recently gotten the disease. A bugbear who contracts
Tormach’s Rage can’t expect to live long as the illness
compels the victim to acts of aggression that ultimately
end in the bugbear’s destruction. The infection lasts until
death, although magic and rare herbal knowledge can
counteract it.
   Very rarely, an infected bugbear lives long enough
that Tormach’s Rage exhibits advanced symptoms. At
this stage, the disease further accentuates the bugbear’s
muscular system, granting increased strength and speed.
Bugbears who live this long have little impulse control
and ability to reason.

                 “Folks say they were once humans. An old forest goddess
               cursed them for being too greedy for magic. Not sure I believe
                         that, but it explains that glint in their eyes.”


             Magic Seekers. Cadeers look like deer, but they have
             the tail of a snake and black, featureless eyes. They’re
             not only sapient, but highly intelligent. Cadeers can also
             sense and track magic over long distances, and they seek
             it out with zeal.

             Untrustworthy Partners. A cadeer might partner with
             other beings to seek and ﬁnd magic. But they can’t be trusted
             to share anything that’s found. Cadeers prioritize their
             desires and goals. And they might even switch sides in a
             battle if doing so means acquiring the magic they’re after.

             Antler Absorption. Cadeer antlers can’t be harmed
             by magic, but they can store it. A cadeer can use a spell
             stored in this way. To keep a spell, a cadeer can also
             prevent the antlers from absorbing more magic.

             Cadeer antlers are valuable, fetching at least 75 gp each.
             A cadeer antler can be fashioned into a wand suitable as
             a spellcasting focus for arcane spellcasters and druids.
             If made into a magic item, this wand has 1 extra charge

             counterspell works. The wielder adds the number rolled                               and absorb low-powered spells, allowing the cadeer to

            Hidden Hunters. Carvaloths are ancient predators that
            possess the ability to change their skin color, much like
            a chameleon. This trait functions as camouﬂage, when
            stalking prey or hiding from other predators, and as a
            display of dominance toward other packs of carvaloths.

            ﬁlled with caustic spittle that eats through stone, metal,
            and ﬂesh. A lone carvaloth is ﬁerce and dangerous.
            In packs, these predators can quickly outnumber and
            overwhelm larger creatures.

DC 10 Intelligence (History): The Champions of Filth
are a sect of knights who revere disease. They believe
that sickness plays an important role in the cycle of
life and death, weeding out the weak and allowing the
strong to ﬂourish.

DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine): Champions of Filth allow
themselves to be infected with any disease they encounter,
treating it as a rite of passage that leaves them stronger
than before. They are immune to these plagues, but they
can be dangerous carriers.

DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): The strongest
Champions of Filth, the blightwalkers, are so infested
with disease that any contact with their magic or
weapons can cause ﬂesh to wither away.

its pronouncements of doom, it summons succubi or

other ﬁends to spread fear and despair.

When slain, the eyes of a doomcaller harden into gems

worth 2000 gp each.

   When a creature holding one of these gems makes

an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, they can

consume it to improve their fortunes. After the roll has

been made, but before the GM has announced the result

of the roll, the player can expend one gem and reroll the

roll. Once done, the player must use the new result, the

gem shatters and becomes worthless.

              “A dream can be a beautiful thing, until you can’t escape it.”

           Dream Born. Dream spirits are manifestations of

           memories released when a sentient creature dies thinking

           of a speciﬁc moment in their life. Powerful arcane magic

           can also pull these spirits from a creature. Living dreams

           are positive or emotionally neutral memories. Conversely,

           a living nightmare is malevolent, so it harms those around

           it. Wicked mages or other hateful, potent beings transform

           living dreams into living nightmares through rituals.

           Psychic Feeding. Living dreams are warm, blue motes

           of swirling light that attract the curious and naïve. They

           charm creatures into a stupor, feeding off the creatures’

           psychic energy as the charmed beings experience parts

           of the dream.

               Living nightmares are hot, red motes that act aggressively.

           They create fear to maximize their brutal psychic assaults.

           These attacks and powers give the victims glimpses of                                Living dreaM

The exploded metal hide of the Empyrean brazen bull

can be harvested to make gleaming and radiant brazen

armor (see Chapter 4). A proﬁcient armor smith can make

a suit of brazen armor by succeeding on a DC 20 Strength

process takes 20 days to complete.

           Gillian Hammerstorm

                    “Her? Oh, she’s a regular here. Drinks until she
                    gets into a ﬁght, wins more often than not, then
                                calls it a night. Sweet girl.”

           Storm Break. For over a thousand years the Hammer-
           storm clan mined the Rock-Teeth Mountains to the east
           of Liesech. After the Weeping Pox swept through the city,
           it found its way to the Hammerstorm’s underground
           domain, where it decimated the clan. Less than ﬁve years
           later, only a handful of dwarves remained. The survivors
           realized they could not sustain their ancestral estates and
           dispersed to other lands. Gillian, the youngest surviving
           Hammerstorm, settled in Liesech.

           Demon in a Bottle. Since the dissolution of her clan,
           Gillian has taken to spending her inheritance drinking
           away her nights. She came to Liesech hopeful that she
           could earn a lasting heroic legacy for the Hammerstorm
           name, but the rampant cynicism and brutality of the city
           quickly wore her down—and she abandoned her dream.
           Quick to anger, Gillian has been kicked out of most
           reputable taverns in the city for starting ﬁghts, leaving
           her to exclusively patronize ale houses of lesser quality.

           Last Call. Player characters who accomplish a heroic
           and public act might catch Gillian’s attention, causing
           her to temporarily set aside her bitterness for the chance
           at redemption. In this circumstance, Gillian tracks the
           player characters down and asks to join their party.
           Otherwise, Gillian can be found at any of Liesech’s seedy
           taverns, and she eagerly joins any group of adventurers
           that pays her tab or helps her win a bar ﬁght.



                                                                                              Heavy Hitter. Gillian scores a critical hit on a result of

                     Abree Simoni

            “She came through two nights ago looking like she was on
            the run. If I’d known she was a deserter I’d have alerted the
                   authorities straightaway, Empyreus’ truth!”


         Trial by Fire. Having lost her parents at a young age
         to a wicked spellcaster, Abree Simoni dedicated her life
         to becoming an inquisitor. Her diligent study of Em-
         pyreus’ dogma earned her the privilege of joining the
         Inquisition’s ranks at fourteen years old. Over the course
         of her ﬁrst years in the Arcanist Inquisition, Abree’s faith
         was unwavering. When her superiors directed her to
         root out corruption, she did so with meticulous fervor
         When asked to put ﬁre to the kindling beneath accused
         spellcasters, she did so without hesitation. Then she was
         deployed to the village where she and her brother had
         been raised by distant family following the death of their
         parents. She discovered her brother was accused of casting
         magic. Her unit was charged with incarcerating him
         until his trial and execution.

         Crisis of Faith. Certain her brother would never
         practice magic, Abree tried to ﬁnd proof of his
         innocence. When she couldn’t, turning up witnesses
         who’d seen him engage in ritual bloodletting, she did
         the unthinkable—she betrayed the Inquisition and ﬂed
         town with her brother. They were on the run only a few
         days when Abree woke in the middle of the night to ﬁnd
                                                                                 assistance. Her ﬁrst goal is to ﬁnd her brother and ensure
         her brother had left her on her own. With no answers to
                                                                                 his safety. She also wishes to ﬂee the lands where the
         the accusation against her brother, and no excuse for her
                                                                                 Arcanist Inquisition holds power. If anyone among the
         superiors, Abree continued her ﬂight from the region.
                                                                                 player characters is an inquisitor, she changes her plans
         Lost and Alone. Now Abree travels from town to                          and asks if they could vouch for her so she can return
         town, trying to make her way out of the Castinellan                     to her post. Regardless, if the player characters agree to
         Provinces unnoticed. Should the player characters win                   assist Abree in keeping her safe from the Inquisition, she

                                                                                 checks for the next 10 minutes. During this time, she

       Grimaldo Simoni


    “They say the Thorn of Sante Viegre has killed a hundred

inquisitors. It’s probably closer to ten, but I can’t deny that the

brutality of his attacks seems to resonate with the common folk.”


Family Secrets. Grimaldo Simoni and his older sister

were raised by cousins. Told from an early age that his

parents had been killed by a warlock, Grimaldo was

tortured by the sense of loss. A sensitive child, he noticed

that older villagers seemed to make a point of avoiding

him and his sister. Only after his sister left to join the

Arcanist Inquisition did he discover the reason late one

night when his cousins had been drinking: his parents

were not killed by a spellcaster but had been accused of

being spellcasters themselves and subsequently put to

death by inquisitors.

Thicker Than Blood. Shortly after learning the

truth of his parents’ deaths, Grimaldo began to study

the occult. He became obsessed with following in his

parents’ footsteps and avenging them by bringing

pain and suffering to as many inquisitors as he could.

When a traveling merchant came through his village

with a book on blood magic, Grimaldo spent everything

he had to buy it. Eventually rumors began to spread

around his village that he was pursuing the arcane arts.

         DC 10 Intelligence (History): Gegazol, Scourge of the
         North, is an ancient dragon transformed into an undead
         horror millennia ago. Tales as old as creation tell of her
         infrequent but violent assaults on lands south of her lair,
         and all lands of Etharis are south of her lair.
         DC 15 Intelligence (Religion): Not only possessing
         great physical power, defenses against magic, and an
         undead army at her back, Gegazol, like a lich, has a soul
         vessel that harbors her undead soul and can rejuvenate
         her body when Gegazol is destroyed. It’s said that this
         vessel is a massive daemon skull, and that the dragon
         keeps it hidden in her lair.
         DC 20 Intelligence (History): Gegazol calls the
         undead who serve her Immortals’. Among them are
         vampires, ghouls, and undead that are even more
         powerful. Given many of these undead have fallen
         in her wars and powerplays, the Immortal title
         is aspirational.

         Gore Elemental

       “The blood, ﬂesh, sinew, and viscera congeal across
        the battleﬁeld, taking a vaguely humanoid shape.
                  Somewhere, Tormach is pleased.”

Tormach’s Glee. The Arch Daemon Tormach revels
in slaughter, and in places where death and carnage
preside for an extended period, the concentration of
bloodlust and death spawns a gore elemental. Cultists
of Tormach may also summon such an elemental to do
their gruesome bidding.

Mobile Sepulcher. The gore elemental is little more than
a barely sentient pile of the vilest remnants of battle: blood,
rent ﬂesh, broken bones, vomit, bile, and torn innards.

saLvage

At the center of a gore elemental is a skull, which belonged
to the most powerful creature that perished at the slaughter
that created the gore elemental. With a successful DC 15
Intelligence (Arcana) and 100 gp worth of components,
one can create a talisman of Tormach (see Chapter 4). This
process takes 8 hours.

LOre

DC 10 Intelligence (History): The gore elemental
is created at the site of great slaughter, showing that
Tormach was pleased by the events.

DC 15 Intelligence (Religion): Creatures caught
inside the gore elemental are assaulted by not just the
bone and metal inside it, but also the vile power of
Tormach that makes such a creature possible.

           melody, the fey can damage the mind using cruel notes

Nightmare Incarnate. Grinstagger is a mighty oni
known throughout Etharis for his cruelty and unique
appearance. One side of his body is rigid and plantlike,
giving him a perpetual grin and a staggering gait. Hence
his name. Oni are the subject of numerous tales and
frightful children’s rhymes, but Grinstagger is known
and feared even among his kind.
Unchecked Ambition. Grinstagger entered a pact
with a fey queen in exchange for more arcane power.
He never intended to become a slave to another,
however. Using ancient magic, Grinstagger wrested
control of his pact away from his patron. Enraged, she
sent numerous servants to hunt down the rogue
warlock, but he eluded or slew each one.
Twisted Punishment. Unable to subdue Grinstagger,
the fey queen cursed the oni. With each use of his power,
Grinstagger’s ﬂesh hardened into a woody substance.
His face locked in a rictus and his right side stiffened,
giving him a limp. But this punishment did little to deter
Grinstagger, who redirected the curse, freeing himself
from its continuing effects before slipping from his
former patron’s clutches.

            escaped the curse, but its previous effects remain, giving

            Grinstagger his unique appearance.

                            Grudgels

                   “Fairy tales describing orcs as monsters who
                disappeared turned out to be just that. Orcs didn’t
                       disappear, and they’re not monsters.”

         Living Legends. Even the longest-lived people of Etharis
         don’t remember grudgels, but they remember their elders
         speaking of these dreaded creatures: humanoid monsters
         who used their ferocity and martial prowess to lay waste to
         towns before disappearing. These myths lingered, but the
         grudgels have returned. These beings, unlike those of the
         terrible tales, are measured and wise. They don’t speak of
         their communal past, but they seem to carry an otherworldly
         knowledge with them. Grudgels look to the stars as if those
         far-ﬂung orbs are memories rather than mysteries.

         Skillful Warriors. Grudgels, now wandering in from
         the wilderness in small groups, are proving to be valuable
         members of the communities they join, assuming they’re
         not killed on sight out of misguided fear. The grudgels
         employ advanced building and crafting techniques, and
         they share this knowledge, alongside a willingness to
         work. These traits help others overcome initial hesitation
         at the sudden appearance of an unusual stranger.
             Grudgels are often peaceful and helpful, but they know
         how to ﬁght. They’re as skilled at battle as they are at other
         trades. Some have training in advanced magic, which they
         use, as with their weapons, mostly to maintain peace.

                  “When the imps start to ﬁght in the full moon’s light
                   The wise witch knows soon the hell’s reach grows.”

           Although no larger than a sizable mushroom, a hell’s reach
           has a touch of infernal origin. Six red tentacles remain
           hidden in a fungal dome until a passerby disrupts the
           mushroom’s slumber. Then, the tentacles erupt from
           the mushroom to attack, reeking of rotting ﬂesh. Each
           tentacle contains juices that react with air to ignite. When
           the mushroom is damaged, this liquid squirts from it.

           Ring of Fire. A cluster of hell’s reaches is called a ring
           of ﬁre. It’s best avoided, much like a fairy circle.

           Someone who has proﬁciency with alchemist’s supplies or
           an herbalism kit can use the remains of one ring of ﬁre (or
           about a dozen hell’s reaches) and reagents worth 25 gp to
           brew an oil that can be applied to armor in 10 minutes. One
           dose of this oil conveys resistance to ﬁre damage to the armor
           and to the wearer while the armor is worn for 24 hours after
           the oil is applied. Brewing the oil requires 4 hours of work

handsomely for samples. Bounties for these creatures in
urban areas range from 10 to 100 gp.

                “The motley-clad creature’s spindly arms and legs ﬂail

                     wildly as it dashes toward the shrieking child.”


           Fey Oddity. A fey creature of mischief rather than

           menace, the horror-out-the-box is so named because of its

           oddly shaped and distended legs and arms, the colors of

           its garments along its limbs resembling pleating like a

           child’s toy, as well as its face, colored like a jester wearing

           a domino mask.

               A horror-out-the-box prefers to remain in areas with

           a strong fey presence, but outside of such environs it can

           be found in urban areas, where it might easily ﬁnd its

           chaotic amusement.

A central spike growing from the hraptnon can be fash-
ioned into a spear or lance by a proﬁcient weaponsmith
succeeding on a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check. This
takes 10 days of work and 1000 gp of components. The
spear or lance acts as a +3 weapon that does an additional 7
(2d6) force damage on a successful hit. This magical weapon
can affect the hraptnon, unlike other magical weapons.

DC 15 Intelligence (History): The hraptnon lives in
the Stillborn Forest, and it has never been seen outside of
the forest bounds.

DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): No magical spells or
weapons can hurt the hraptnon, and its blood can spawn
creatures known as xakalonus.

DC 25 Intelligence (History): The hraptnon cannot be
permanently killed unless its heart, which rests in a magical
pool in a grove at the center of the Stillborn Forest, is found
and destroyed. This heart, known as the Stillborn Heart,
could be sold to a sage for a large sum of gold.

Brave sailors hunt keppmirs for their horns. Someone
who has proﬁciency with alchemist’s supplies can use
one horn combined with other reagents, including
dried seaweed from the Sea of Turmoil, to create a
potion of glacial resistance (see chapter 4). Creating the
potion requires 4 hours of work and a successful DC 13
Intelligence (Arcana) check.
   The ancient Crown of the Keppmir King (see chapter 4)
has never been removed from his massive horns. Anyone
who could defeat the leader could claim this prize.

                          --Excerpt from a Bürach nursery rhyme

            Forest Blight. Maiden’s hair is a deadly plant found in
            remote forests. They resemble long ﬂowing tufts of golden
            grass or moss, frequently hanging from tree limbs.

            Delusional Scent. The maiden’s hair releases a
            poisonous scent, barely noticeable by most humanoids.
            However, intelligent creatures affected by this poison
            become enamored with the plant. Poisoned victims
            who survive encounters with maiden’s hair describe
            visions of an attractive individual with long ﬂowing
            hair calling them forward.

            Hag’s Favorite. Hags often cultivate these plants
            to protect their dismal lairs, leaving skeletons of past
            victims beneath the deadly plants to warn potential

False Appearance. While the maiden’s hair remains

Enamoring Scent. Creatures who start their turn
within 20 feet of maiden’s hair must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the creature
is poisoned for 1 hour. At the end of each minute, the
poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the
effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully
saves is immune to the maiden’s hair enamoring scent
for the next 24 hours.
   While poisoned by the maiden’s hair, creatures are
charmed and incapacitated. If the charmed creature is
more than 5 feet away from the maiden’s hair, the target
must move on its turn toward the maiden’s hair by the
most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t
avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into
damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever
it takes damage from a source other than the maiden’s
hair, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the

   A strong breeze, such as that created by the gust
of wind spell, can dissipate the enamoring scent,

                            A Memori Lich’s Lair

            A memori lich might haunt an ancient battleﬁeld or
            a fortress from which it can lead undead soldiers.

            Lair aCtiOns

            On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the memori
            lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following
            magical effects. The memori lich can’t use the same effect
            two rounds in a row.

            •  The ground within 120 feet of the memori lich shakes
              violently for a moment. Each creature of the memori
              lich’s choice in that area must succeed on a DC 16
              Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
            •  Creatures of the memori lich’s choice within 60 feet of
              the lich can’t regain hit points until initiative count 20
              on the next round.
            •  Shades of those the memori lich has slain swirl around
              in a 30-foot sphere centered on the lich. This effect goes
              around corners. The shades help the lich, and so the
              lich rolls 1d4 with the d20 rolled for any ability check
              or saving throw, adding the number rolled on the d4
              to the result. The apparitions hinder those hostile to
              the lich and outline them with a faint glow. The area
              is difﬁcult terrain for such creatures, and they can’t
              beneﬁt from being invisible while in the area. These
              beneﬁts last until initiative count 20 on the next round.

            Disaster Seekers. Mothfolk are often found around
            disasters, relishing the mayhem.

            Red Glow. The mothfolk have giant red glowing eyes.
            Creatures that stare too long into them are terriﬁed at
            what those eyes reveal.

                    presence, yet it manages to creep unnoticed through the

               Hideous Hybrid. A nacambra resembles a hornless
               goat, but has large ears and a long, ﬂexible tail that can
               be used as a whip. It’s often seen walking backwards
               with its head lowered between its hind legs.

               Horrible Odor. A nacambra exudes a stench of decay
               that can overwhelm the senses of nearby creatures,
               causing them to become nauseated. The stench serves
               as a defense mechanism.

               easy prey, sometimes it emerges from its lair in search
               of children, who it kills to harvest their hearts, which its
               master uses to fashion amulets.

        “Our invader does nothing but laugh at our pain.
              Someone, anyone, save our little town!”

Cursed Giant. A potbelly is a giant cursed by unseelie
fey. What remains is the mockery of a giant ﬁlled with
the desire to cook and consume other living beings. The
giant’s name comes from its new appearance. A cauldron
hangs in the giant’s abdomen. It contains a bizarre boiling
oil, and the potbelly can use this vessel to cook foes.

Gleeful Mayhem. A potbelly always smiles and joyfully
goes about murdering and cooking other creatures. It
happily snacks on fried corpses from its belly pot while
crushing other foes. Even at the edge of death, a potbelly
keeps up this twisted good cheer.

saLvage
The cooking ﬂuid in a potbelly’s cauldron cools and
evaporates quickly after the potbelly dies. Someone who
has proﬁciency with alchemist’s supplies can preserve
some of the ﬂuid within 1 minute of the fey giant’s
death. This sample can be used to create a sizzling serum
(see chapter 4). Brewing this serum takes 4 hours and
reagents worth 50 gp, and it requires a successful DC 13
Intelligence (Nature) check.

DC 13 Intelligence (History): A potbelly is a giant
cursed by fey magic. It can grab smaller creatures and
cook them in its belly pot.

supernatural boost from eating those who died in the
giant’s stomach cauldron.

Someone who has proﬁciency with alchemist’s supplies
can brew and reﬁne the blood of one quoxxarie with
reagents worth 100 gp to make a potion of relentlessness
(see chapter 4). The process takes 8 hours, and the
alchemist must succeed on a DC 15 Intelligence or
Wisdom check.

DC 10 Intelligence (History): The four kinds of
quoxxarie are distinguished by their different colors. Red is
the most common, while gray is the deadliest and rarest.

DC 15 Intelligence (Nature): Quoxxaries are
aggressive, fast, and ruthless. They respond to attacks
with crushing blows and are impossible to poison.

DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): Four quoxxaries of
differing colors ﬁghting alongside one another makes a
deadly combination. Their auras complement each other,
spelling big trouble for the quoxxaries’ enemies.

   Raven of Ill Omen


          “Ravens can be a sign of bad tidings, but their

             monarchs bring mischief and upheaval.”

Raven “Rulers.” Ravens of ill omen are larger than

normal ravens. A plume of feathers, red and white, and

alabaster eyes set it further apart from its kin. These regal

ravens also have magical inﬂuence over fortune. This

prescience causes misfortune for the raven’s enemies and

good luck for fellow corvids.

   Ravens are harbingers of misfortune. A raven of

ill omen is the embodiment of this belief. When one

appears, battleﬁeld deaths increase, pestilence spreads

quickly, and misery abounds.

Cunning Deceivers. Contrary to popular superstition,

ravens of ill omen aren’t beasts. These mischievous

creatures are fey who actively spread misfortune. They

inﬂuence ravens and sometimes ally with other fey,

drawing unwitting creatures into traps and nasty

schemes through mimicry and other tricks.

DC 10 Intelligence (History): Although all celestials
were once united in service to the gods, in the time since
their disappearance, the Arch Seraphs designs have seen
many changes to their servants’ nature.
DC 10 Intelligence (Arcana): Eyes of Zabriel are
spies, and their light literally shines on those around
them, watching and judging with radiant energy.

bloodied can never be removed or their self-sacriﬁce will
go unchecked, and they die instantly. The bloodied turn

           Subtle Parasites. Not unlike the common head louse,

           snarites start incredibly small and pass from head to

           of hair—or a thick braid when they are at their most

           powerful—snarites burrow into the scalp and grow

           slowly. If the creature they’ve attached to isn’t the sort

           to regularly trim their hair, snarites can go unnoticed for

           years. By the time snarites are long and thick enough to

           be differentiated from normal hair, it’s too late to get rid

           of them without a ﬁght.

DC 10 Intelligence (Religion): Soman vampires are
undead who feed on the blood of the living by night and
the hard work of the living by day. These vampires can
pass as human and live according to rules. Other Soman
vampires shun their fellows who give in to bloodlust or
needlessly terrorize mortals.

DC 15 Intelligence (Religion): Like other vampires,
Soman vampires can’t enter dwellings unless invited.
Sunlight bothers them, but only the elder Soman vampires
suffer as much in sunlight as normal vampires do. These
elders also have other weaknesses common to other
vampires, such as being paralyzed by a stake to the heart.
Many Soman vampires get around the home ban by owning
the homes that their serfs and servants live in, giving the
vampire freedom to enter at any time.

DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): The gaze of elder
Soman vampires is particularly insidious, allowing them
to inﬁltrate and manipulate the minds of mortals. They
use this ability to retain their aristocratic hold over the
Soman population.

           When a withered steed dies, it becomes a mass of gore

           If someone frees the raven and cares for it for 10 days, it
           becomes bound to that person who can then summon it

           organic material. They can become massive. In such

           The remains of a tar creep can be used as the main ingredient
           for alchemist’s ﬁre. The remains of one tar creep provides
           enough pitch to cut the cost of making ten ﬂasks of
           alchemist’s ﬁre by 50%. A tar juggernaut provides enough

                   Thornhost

         “I always carry a knife around these parts. Some
        of the plants around here have poison thorns, sure,
               but others have something far worse.”

Grisly Puppeteers. Often mistaken for zombies,
thornhosts are parasitic plants that propagate through
burrowing thorns. Once the thorns sink into ﬂesh, they
spread roots throughout the body, eventually controlling
the still-living but brain-dead body of the host. This body
withers as if from a wasting disease, and a thorny mass
forms in the abdomen.

Walking Bomb. Once a thornhost has matured, the
central mass swells and becomes unstable. The plant
forces the body toward areas of high population, seeking
to maximize the number of potential hosts. When its life
becomes endangered, the plant bursts, shooting thorny
seeds in all directions.

            Etharis is teeming with strange and mutated beasts. The

            that characters might encounter on their travels.

           Cousins to mountain lions, corpsejaws are battleﬁeld
           scavengers. Their powerful jaws allow them to tear
           through most armor, so they can eat carrion other
           scavengers leave behind. Military organizations such as
           the Free Swords issue bounties on corpsejaws to prevent
           damage to valuable salvage.

          “A mother clutches her three young daughters in the hallway,
           outside a bedroom where a male voice rants in gibberish. She
           lets a masked ﬁgure into the room. A shriek precedes silence.

          corpses of Weeping Pox victims murdered before the

          attracts death energy, and they rise with the need to
          spread the plague for revenge. They have no personality
          or memory of their former lives.

          Diseased Transformation. Deep lesions score a
          weeping zombie, especially around the mouth. This
          oriﬁce hangs open, dry and shriveled, and the zombie
          gasps unintelligible words as it moves. Once near a
          living body, the weeping zombie rushes in and attempts
          an embrace to spread the disease and consume ﬂesh.

Multiattack. The vampire makes three attacks, only

one of which can be a bite.

Claws. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.

Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. If the target is a creature,

the vampire can grapple the target (escape DC 15).

Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.

Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage and 10 (3d6) necrotic

damage. The target’s hit point maximum is reduced by

an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken, and the

vampire regains hit points equal to that amount. This

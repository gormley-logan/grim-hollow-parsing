False Appearance.
While the grief eater remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a person cloaked
in grey, sitting and clutching their legs.
Grief Sense.
The grief eater can sense a frightened or
despairing humanoid or another grief eater within 60 ft.
of it. A grief eater using this sense knows the target’s
location and direction of movement.
Light Sensitivity.
While in bright light, the grief eater
has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom
(Perception) checks that rely on sight.
actions
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage. If the target is
frightened, or full of sorrow or despair, it also takes
4 (1d4 + 2) psychic damage. The target’s hit point maximum
is reduced by an amount equal to the psychic damage
taken, and the grief eater regains hit points equal to that
amount. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a
long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point
maximum to 0. If a humanoid is slain in this way and left
unburied, a grief eater emerges from the corpse 24 hours
later, provided the body is in darkness.
Wail.
With a heartrending cry, the grief eater evokes
despair in one creature it can sense within 30 feet of it. The
target must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or
become frightened for 1 minute. A creature already full of
sorrow has disadvantage on the save. The target can repeat
the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success. If a creature’s saving throw is
successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to
the Wail of any grief eater for the next 24 hours.

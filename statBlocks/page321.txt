Adhesive.
The spythronar web adheres to anything that
touches it. To avoid adhering when touching the web, a
creature must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw,
but a creature hit by the web’s crush attack doesn’t receive
a saving throw. A Huge or smaller creature adhered to the
web is also grappled by it (escape DC 13). If adhered to a
target larger than it can grapple, the web can release the
adhesive or remain adhered and be dragged along as the
target moves. Neither choice requires an action from the
web. Removing an object adhered to the web or the web
from anything it’s adhered to requires a successful DC 13
Strength (Athletics) check as an action.
Amorphous.
The spythronar web can move through a
space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
False Appearance.
While the spythronar web remains
motionless and takes no action, it is indistinguishable
from a large, thick spider web.
Spider Climb.
A spythronar web can climb difficult
surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without
needing to make an ability check.
Web Sense.
While in contact with a web, the
spythronar web knows the exact location of any other
creature in contact with the same web.
Web Walker.
The spythronar web ignores movement
restrictions caused by webbing.
actions
Crush.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage and
Adhesive. The target is also restrained while grappled in this
way, and the spythronar web can’t crush another target.
Lightning Surge.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
reach 30 ft., one target.
Hit: 9 (2d8) lightning damage.
If the spythronar web has a creature grappled and
attacks another target, the grappled creature also takes
this damage.

Furtive.
The spythronar swarm can use a bonus action
to take the Hide action.
Spider Climb.
The spythronar swarm can climb
difficult surfaces, including upside down on ceilings,
without needing to make an ability check.
Swarm.
The spythronar swarm can occupy another
creature’s space and vice versa, and the swarm can move
through any opening large enough for a Tiny arachnid. The
swarm can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
Web Sense.
While in contact with a web, the
spythronar swarm knows the exact location of any other
creature in contact with the same web.
Web Walker.
The spythronar swarm ignores
movement restrictions caused by webbing.
actions
Bites.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 0 ft., one
creature in the swarm’s space.
Hit: 10 (4d4) piercing
damage and 9 (2d8) lightning damage, or 5 (2d4)
piercing damage and 4 (1d8) lightning damage if the
swarm has half of its hit points or fewer.
Weave (4/Day).
The spythronar swarm weaves
webbing, covering a 5-foot square. The swarm can then
give up 1 hit point to create a spythronar sac in that
space. If the swarm’s webbing covers a 10-foot square,
it can give up 23 hit points as part of the same action,
creating a spythronar web with the same number of hit
points. The swarm can’t drop to 0 hit points to create a
sac or web.
If the swarm weaves an incomplete web, that web
is a normal web rather than a sentient, monstrous one.
A creature that enters this normal web’s space must
succeed on a DC 10 Strength saving throw or become
grappled (escape DC 10) and restrained while grappled
in this way. Each 5-foot square of this web has AC 10; the
damage vulnerabilities, immunities, and resistances of a
spythronar web; and 5 hit points.

Enamoring Scent.
Creatures who start their turn
within 20 feet of maiden’s hair must succeed on a DC
12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure the creature
is poisoned for 1 hour. At the end of each minute, the
poisoned target can repeat the saving throw, ending the
effect on itself on a success. A target that successfully
saves is immune to the maiden’s hair enamoring scent
for the next 24 hours.
While poisoned by the maiden’s hair, creatures are
charmed and incapacitated. If the charmed creature is
more than 5 feet away from the maiden’s hair, the target
must move on its turn toward the maiden’s hair by the
most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It doesn’t
avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into
damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever
it takes damage from a source other than the maiden’s
hair, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the
poisoned effect on a success
A strong breeze, such as that created by the

suppressing this effect for the duration of the breeze.

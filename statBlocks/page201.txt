Amorphous.
The ooze can move through a space as
narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Corrode Magic.
Any magical weapon that hits the
ooze has some of its magic stripped away. After dealing
damage, the weapon takes a cumulative -1 penalty to
attack and damage rolls. If the penalty reaches -3, the
weapon permanently becomes a mundane version of
that weapon type
.
A weapon affected by this magical
draining reduces the penalty by 1 at the end of each long
rest. Magical ammunition that hits the ooze becomes
mundane immediately after dealing damage.
False Appearance.
While the ooze remains motionless,
it is indistinguishable from an oily pool or wet rock.

Melee Weapon Attack
: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit
: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 36 (8d8) force damage. In addition, magical armor worn by
the target begins to be stripped of its power and takes a
cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. If the penalty
reaches -3, the armor permanently becomes a mundane
version of that armor type. Armor affected by this
magical draining reduces the penalty by 1 at the end
of each long rest.

. When a magebane ooze takes damage from a spell
attack, it can reduce the damage from that attack to 0 and
instead regains hit points equal to the damage that was
originally dealt.

ogresh vampire customization
An ogresh vampire is agile for their mass, but less so than
a typical vampire of their age (lower Dexterity and AC).
The vampire makes up for the slowdown with sheer
durability (higher Constitution and hit points) and higher
Charisma. An ogresh vampire also gains its proficiency
bonus on Constitution saving throws but lacks it on
Dexterity saves. These vampires are immune to disease
and poison, and they canâ€™t be charmed. However, an
ogresh vampire can use Charm on others but lacks Beast
Form. Ancient ogresh vampires can affect any sort of
creature with their Charm, not only humanoids or beasts.
Ogresh vampires gain the Massive trait in their later years.

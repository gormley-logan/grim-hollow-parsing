Amorphous.
The tar creep can move through a space as
narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Kindle.
When a tar creep takes fire damage, it ignites.
The creep’s slam attacks then adhere flaming pitch to
foes, dealing an extra 4 (1d8) fire damage and igniting
them, too. In either case, until an ignited creature takes
an action to douse the fire, the creature takes 5 (1d10) fire
damage at the start of each of its turns.
actions
Multiattack.
The tar creep makes two slam attacks. It
can use engulf in place of either attack.
Slam.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target.
Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target
is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC
15). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained. The
tar creep can grapple up to two creatures at a time.
Engulf.
One creature grappled by the tar creep must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be pulled
into the creep’s body. An engulfed target is blinded,
restrained, unable to breathe, and has total cover from
effects that originate outside the creep. At the start of
each of the creep’s turns, the engulfed creature takes 13
(3d8) bludgeoning damage and the same fire damage the
creep takes from Kindle, if any. The creep can have only
one creature engulfed at a time.
An engulfed creature can try to escape by taking an
action to make its choice of a DC 15 Strength (Athletics)
or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a success, the creature
escapes and uses 5 feet of movement to enter a space of its
choice within 5 feet of the creep.
If the creep dies, an engulfed creature is no longer
restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using
10 feet of movement.
If a creature dies while engulfed by the creep, the
creature’s body dissolves inside the elemental. The creep
expels anything the creature wore or carried.

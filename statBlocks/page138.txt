actions
Multiattack.
The gozomite makes one bite attack and
one stinger attack.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit
: 8 (1d8 + 4) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. A successful DC 15 Constitution saving
throw halves the poison damage.
Stinger.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +7 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
Hit
: 9 (1d10 + 4) piercing damage and the target is injected with hundreds of the gozomite’s eggs that hatch
after 2d4 rounds. Applying fire that deals 1 fire damage
to the sting wound before the eggs hatch kills the eggs.
At the start of each of the target’s turns after the eggs
hatch, the target takes 14 (4d6) piercing damage as the
gozomitelings feast on the host’s flesh.
After the gozomitelings hatch, any creature can use an
action to kill or remove the gozomitelings with fire or a
weapon that deals piercing or slashing damage, causing
10 damage of the appropriate type to the target. A successful
DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check as an action also removes
the gozomitelings. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by
the gozomitelings’ piercing damage dies. The round after
the gozomitelings hatch, the corpse is destroyed, leaving
behind only equipment and bones (or exoskeleton).

Aetheric Drone.
As a bonus action, the mukad strums
its legs together, making a low, psionic buzz that transcends
hearing. Each non-aberration within 30 feet of the mukad
must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or become
charmed by the mukad. Creatures fighting the mukad or
its allies have advantage on this save. While charmed
in this way, a creature has disadvantage on Wisdom
(Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other
than the mukad droner using this action. The effect
ends if the droner ends it (no action required), becomes
incapacitated, or fails to use a bonus action to continue it.

Brute.
A melee weapon deals one extra die of its
damage when the rage-infected bugbear hits with it
(included in the attack).
Keen Smell.
The rage-infected bugbear has advantage
on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
Rampage.
When the rage-infected bugbear reduces a
creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn,
the bugbear can take a bonus action to move up to half
its speed and make a bite attack.
Tormach’s Rage.
The disease Tormach’s Rage causes
a rage-infected bugbear to be chaotic evil and grants
the bugbear an extra 2 (1d4) damage on Strength-based
attacks (included in the attacks). Also, at the start of
its turn, the bugbear can gain advantage on all melee
weapon attack rolls it makes until the start of its next
turn, but attack rolls against it have advantage until the
start of its next turn.
Any bugbear that comes into physical contact with
the rage-infected bugbear must succeed on a DC 14
Constitution saving throw or contract this disease. Only
greater restoration
, similarly powerful magic, or a special
herbal concoction (see Salvage) can cure this disease.

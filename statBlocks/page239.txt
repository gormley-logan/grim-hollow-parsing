Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature.
Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) necrotic damage, and the
target must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On
a failure, the target’s available Hit Dice are reduced by 1.
If this effect reduces the target’s Hit Dice to 0, the target
falls unconscious. The target can repeat the saving throw
at the end of each of its turns, regaining consciousness
on a success. Hit Dice lost this way return at the end of a
short rest, in time to spend them to regain hit points.
If an oblivion brute kills a living creature with this
attack when the creature is at 0 Hit Dice, the target’s soul
is lost to the realm of shadow. This lost soul can be raised
from the dead only with mighty magic, such as
wish
or
divine intervention.
Unbearable Howl (Recharges after a Short or
Long Rest).
The oblivion brute emits a howl in a 30-foot
cone. Each creature that isn’t deafened or undead in the
area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or
become frightened for 1 minute. While frightened this
way, a creature’s speed is halved. A frightened target
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target’s
saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the
target is immune to any oblivion brute’s Unbearable
Howl for the next 24 hours.

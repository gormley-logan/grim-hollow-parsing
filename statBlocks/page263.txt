actions
Multiattack.
The potbelly makes two slam attacks.
It can use boil in place of either slam.
Slam.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target.
Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) bludgeoning damage. The
potbelly can deal half damage instead and grapple a
Medium or smaller creature (escape DC 16). The potbelly
can grapple up to two creatures at a time.
Boil.
One Medium or smaller creature grappled by the
potbelly must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw
or be plopped into the potbelly’s belly pot, taking 18 (4d8)
fire damage. A creature in the pot is restrained and has
cover from effects that originate outside the potbelly.
At the start of each of the potbelly’s turns, the engulfed
creature takes 18 (4d8) fire damage. The potbelly can have
only two Medium or smaller creatures boiling at a time.
A boiling creature can try to escape by taking an action
to make its choice of a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) or
Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. On a success, the creature
escapes and uses 5 feet of movement to enter a space of
its choice within 5 feet of the potbelly.
If the potbelly dies, boiling creatures are no longer
restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using
10 feet of movement.
Snack.
The potbelly takes the cooked corpse of a fey,
giant, or humanoid that died no more than 1 minute before
from its belly pot, takes a bite, and regains 25 hit points. The
potbelly can gain this benefit only once from each corpse.

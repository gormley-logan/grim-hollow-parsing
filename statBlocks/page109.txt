as much damage on a successful one.

At the start of each of the Empyrean
brazen bull’s turns, each creature within 5 feet of it takes

brazen bull can make one attack with its bite or hooves

If the attack hits, that creature takes the bite’s damage and

against attacks and other effects outside the Empyrean
brazen bull, and it takes 21 (6d6) fire damage at the start
of each of theEmpyrean brazen bull’s turns.
If the Empyrean brazen bull takes 30 damage or more
on a single turn from a creature inside it, the Empyrean
brazen bull must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate all swallowed
creatures, which fall prone in a space within 10 feet
of the empyrean brazen bull. If the Empyrean brazen
bull dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained
by it and can escape from the corpse using 15 feet of
movement, exiting prone.

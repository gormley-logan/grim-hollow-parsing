When the blightworm ascendant successfully
uses

the countered spell. Until the ascendant uses this reaction
again, the ascendant can cast the copied spell using a
warlock spell slot.

DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana): Blightworms exist to
consume energy, draining worlds until they are depleted
husks. Their hosts gain limited ability to siphon magic
from their foes. The parasite does the same to its host,
eventually merging into a unified being.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): The blightworm can
survive the death of its host. It emerges from the corpse
and attempts to infest a new body. The new host’s soul
departs and that of the original warlock takes its place,
a horrific reward for service to otherworldly forces.

“The blight of arcane magic is the single greatest threat
to the welfare of the common citizenry of Etharis. Until
we take our fight to the farthest corners of the world,
where the ruling powers have yet to be taught the dangers
of arcane magic, the insidious spread of magic cannot
be properly stemmed. Once the local threat is eliminated,
I look forward to traveling and educating folks on
our mission. And where education doesn’t succeed,
a sharp sword will.”

have one of its bones sucked out, resulting in the piercing
damage becoming a reduction in maximum hit points
until magical healing is applied.
Fey Charm.
The bone trader targets one humanoid,
goblinoid, fey, or beast it can see within 30 feet of it.
The target must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving
throw or be magically charmed. The charmed creature
regards the bone trader as a trusted friend to be heeded
and protected. Although the target isn’t under the bone
trader’s control, it takes the bone trader’s requests or
actions in the most favorable way . Each time the bone
trader or its allies do anything harmful to the target, it
can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself
on a success. Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until
the bone trader dies, is on a different plane of existence
from the target, or ends the effect as a bonus action. If a
target’s saving throw is successful, the target is immune
to the bone trader’s fey charm for the next 24 hours.
The bone trader can have no more than one humanoid
charmed at a time, along with up to three beasts.

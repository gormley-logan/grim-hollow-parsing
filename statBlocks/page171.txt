Melee Spell Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature.
Hit
: 8 (2d4 + 3) psychic damage, and the target can’t take reactions until the end of the insic’s next turn.
Possession (1/Day).
One humanoid the insic can
see within 5 ft. of it or touching the instrument the insic
inhabits must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving throw
or be possessed by the insic. The insic then disappears,
and the target is incapacitated and loses control of its
body. The insic controls the body but doesn’t deprive
the target of awareness. The insic has total cover from
effects that originate outside the target other than those
that turn undead. It retains its alignment, Intelligence,
Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed
and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target’s
statistics, but doesn’t gain access to the target’s knowledge,
class features, or proficiencies.
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the possession on a success, but
if the insic remains for 1 minute, the target can no longer
repeat the saving throw. Otherwise, the possession lasts
until the target drops to 0 hit points, the insic ends it as a
bonus action, or the insic is turned or forced out. When
the possession ends, the insic reappears in an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the body. The target is immune to
the Possession of any insic for 24 hours after succeeding
on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

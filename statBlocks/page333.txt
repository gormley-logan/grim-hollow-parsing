fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Demiplane
. The subject content of the tachna becomes
a 60 ft. by 60 ft., sentient demiplane, designed to lure and
trap victims of the tachna gallery’s bloodthirsty appe-
tite. Creatures examining or touching any art within the
tachna gallery must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw
or be pulled into the tachna gallery’s demiplane, in a random
location, chosen by the DM. Those touching a tachna are
pulled in without a save. Once trapped inside, the only
way to leave is to defeat the tachna, which can be attacked
from inside it.
A creature who succeeds on the saving throw is
immune to this trait for 1 hour.
Psychic Aura.
At the start of each of the tachna gallery’s
turns, each creature within its demiplane takes 21 (6d6)
psychic damage.

of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

and 500 gp worth of components. This creates 1 pot
of the pigment.

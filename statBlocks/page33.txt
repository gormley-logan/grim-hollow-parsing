Accursed Death.
When the dragon dies, it exudes a
cloud of sickening, accursed gas. Each creature within 20 ft.
of the dragon must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. However, a creature
that fails two of these saving throws becomes cursed. A
creature cursed in this way takes 10 (3d6) necrotic damage
and can’t regain hit points, and the creature’s hit point
maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic
damage taken. Every 24 hours, the cursed creature takes
10 (3d6) necrotic damage with similar reduction to the
creature’s hit point maximum. If the curse reduces the
target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies.

(8d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

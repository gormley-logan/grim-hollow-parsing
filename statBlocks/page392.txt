dwarf vampire customization
Vampirism connects a dwarf to the element of earth
more closely. A dwarf vampire has the speed of a dwarf
(25 feet) but can burrow and glide through some types of
earth and stone without disturbing it, gaining a burrow
speed and Earth Glide trait. The vampire retains much
dwarven resilience in the form of high Constitution,
immunity to poison, and resistance to effects that turn
undead. The vampire’s darkvision is also better than
normal for a vampire of that age.
A dwarf vampire is slower on their feet (lower
Dexterity and AC). However, their toughness is legend
(higher Constitution and hit points).
Young and older dwarf vampires cannot turn to mist
as other vampires do. Instead, these vampires sink into
the earth or stone when near death—see the Earthen
Escape trait. Those a dwarf vampire slays with a bite also
sink into the earth. This burial is enough to assure rebirth
as a vampire spawn.
Dwarf vampires have a vulnerability to silver unusual
for vampires and ironic for dwarves. It’s an odd reversal
of an affinity for valuable metals dwarves have in life
and the elemental expressions of a dwarf vampire

DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana): These priests draw their
power from maddening entities known as the Aether
Kindred, which some arcane scholars point to as the cause
of the gods’ disappearance. The power granted by such
creatures can produce bizarre and unpredictable effects.
DC 20 Intelligence (Religion): Some eldritch priests
seek to awaken their new “gods” by spreading the story
of the demise of members the Etharis pantheon. As more
people tap into the dreams of the slumbering Kindred,
the creatures begin to rouse. If they wake, the world
is doomed.
gm advice: Spell choice for enemies like eldritch priests are
important. While carrying out inscrutable plans, divination spells
are valuable. In battle, however, spells that protect, damage, or
debuff are needed to properly challenge the characters.

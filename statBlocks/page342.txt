Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature.
Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the
trennensel enters the target’s space and attaches to the
target, moving with the target until detached. While
attached to the target, the trennensel uses its action to
drain blood, and the target loses 5 (1d4 + 3) hit points when
the trennensel does so. Another creature, including the
target, can use an action to detach the trennensel, doing
so by succeeding on a DC 9 Strength (Athletics) check.
The trennensel can detach as part of its movement. It
detaches automatically if it becomes incapacitated or dies.

Alluring Spores.
The wood weird seeder targets one
humanoid it can sense within 10 feet of it. The target must
succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed
by the wood weird seeder. While charmed in this way, a
target can take no reactions and can use its action only to
Dash. If the charmed target is more than 5 feet from the
seeder, the target must move as far as it can toward the
seeder, trying to come within 5 feet. The target avoids
obvious danger, including opportunity attacks. If the target
can’t avoid such danger, the target can repeat the saving
throw before entering the dangerous area. The target also
repeats the saving throw if the target takes damage and at
the end of each of the target’s turns. If any saving throw is
successful, the effect ends on the target. The effect also ends
in 1 minute or if the wood weird seeder is destroyed.

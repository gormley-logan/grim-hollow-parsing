Unnatural Life
. Vitebriates are immune to the effects
of old age and death by natural causes.
Vitebriance
. While on the same plane of existence as
a person charmed by the vitebriateâ€™s
dominate person
ability, a vitebriate may leech 1 hp per day permanently
from the thrall. When a thrall is reduced to 0 hp through
this process, it is killed. Drained hit points are regained
after 7 days of rest.

.

Dominate Person.
A vitebriate can target a single
humanoid with
dominate person
as the spell, with the
following differences: once the vitebriate has chosen the target, it can use this ability only on the chosen target
(until the next day when it can choose a different target
and drop the focus on the current target). The spell does
not require concentration but is broken if the vitebriate is
knocked unconscious involuntarily or killed (though not if
it trances or sleeps). If the person has been charmed for at
least an hour, damage does not force a new saving throw.
reactions
Life Shield (1/Day)
. The vitebriate uses its psychic
link with its thrall to transfer all damage it would take to
its thrall. Damage that goes beyond what would kill the
thrall is dealt to the vitebriate.

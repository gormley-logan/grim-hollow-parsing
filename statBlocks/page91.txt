actions
Slam
.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit
: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the target has disadvantage on their next attack roll.
Additionally, all attacks against the target by allies of the
doomcaller are made with advantage until the start of
the doomcaller’s next turn.
Summon Fiend (1/Day)
. The doomcaller chooses
what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.
A doomcaller has a 60 percent chance of summoning
1d6 succubi or 1d4 barbed devils. A summoned fiend
appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its
summoner, does as it pleases, and can’t summon other
fiends. The summoned fiend remains for 1 minute, until
it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a
bonus action to dismiss it.
reactions
Ill Fortune (3/Day)
. When a creature the doomcaller
can see makes an attack roll, a saving throw, or an ability
check, the doomcaller can roll a d20 and choose to use
this roll in place of the attack roll, saving throw, or
ability check.

Amorphous.
The coldfire ooze can move through a
space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Coldfire.
The cold damage a coldfire ooze deals ignores
cold resistance. Creatures immune to cold treat their cold
immunity as resistance to cold damage instead.
Ignite.
If a creature or a flammable object takes cold
damage from the coldfire ooze, the target ignites. Until
the target is dealt fire damage, it takes 3 (1d6) cold
damage at the start of each of its turns.
Illumination.
The coldfire ooze sheds bright light in
a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
Spider Climb.
The coldfire ooze can climb difficult
surfaces, including upside down on ceilings, without
needing to make an ability check.
actions
Pseudopod.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage and 14 (4d6)
cold damage.
Coldfire Flare (Recharge 6).
The coldfire ooze expels
coldfire in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must
make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) cold
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one. If a significant amount of flammable material
ignites due to this flare, the area deals damage as the Ignite
trait to objects and to creatures who enter the area for the first
time on a turn or who end their turn there. This damage
from coldfire also subjects targets to Ignite.
reactions
Split.
When a coldfire ooze that is Medium or larger is
subjected to cold or slashing damage, it splits into two new
oozes if it has at least 10 hit points. Each new ooze has hit
points equal to half the original ooze’s, rounded down.
New oozes are one size smaller than the original ooze.

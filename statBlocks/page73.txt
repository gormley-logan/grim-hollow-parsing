Whenever the crawling grave enters a
creature’s space, if the target is incapacitated or dead, the
crawling grave picks up that creature. The creature moves
with the crawling grave and has disadvantage on death
saving throws. A creature that ceases being incapacitated
or dead can stop moving with the crawling grave.
A corpse breaks apart in the crawling grave at the end
of the crawling grave’s second turn carrying that corpse.
When the corpse breaks apart, the crawling grave regains
hit points equal to half that corpse’s normal hit point
maximum, up to 20 hit points, and expels anything the
corpse was carrying or wearing. Another creature can
pull a corpse free of the crawling grave before it breaks
apart by using an action and succeeding on a DC 13
Strength (Athletics) check. The attempt provokes an
opportunity attack from the crawling grave.
Swarmlike.
The crawling grave can occupy another
creature’s space and vice versa, and the crawling grave
can move through any opening large enough for a
Small humanoid.
Undead Fortitude.
If damage reduces the crawling
grave to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving
throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the
damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success,
the crawling grave drops to 1 hit point instead.
actions
Multiattack.
The crawling grave makes two slam attacks.
Slam.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 14 (2d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the
target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength
or Dexterity saving throw (target’s choice) or fall prone.
If the crawling grave has half of its hit points or fewer, it
deals 8 (1d10 + 3) bludgeoning damage and can’t knock
creatures prone.

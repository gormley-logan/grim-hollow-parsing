Parasitic Release
.
When a danxoni dies, the creatures
inside it escape, some seeking new hosts. These creatures
create a cloud around the dead danxoni in a 10-foot
radius sphere that goes around corners. Any creature in
that area must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving
throw or become infected with the sewer plague disease.

Sunwraith Weapons.
The sunwraith’s weapon
attacks are magical. When the sunwraith hits with any
weapon, the weapon deals an extra 4d8 necrotic or
radiant damage (it’s choice, included in the attacks).
actions
Multiattack
. The sunwraith makes two melee attacks.
Greatsword.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 19 (4d6 + 5) slashing damage and 18 (4d8)
necrotic or radiant damage.
Life Burn (Recharge 6).
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to
hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
Hit: 30 (6d8 + 3) necrotic or
radiant damage. The target must succeed on a DC 16
Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is
reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This
reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The
target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.
A humanoid that dies from this effect rises as a
specter at the start of the sunwraith’s next turn. The
specter is under the sunwraith’s command, following
orders to the best of its ability. A sunwraith can control
seven specters at a time.
reactions
Blinding Corona.
When an attack or effect harms
the sunwraith from farther than 5 feet from it, the
attacker must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving
throw, provided it can see the sunwraith, or be
blinded for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect
on itself on a success.

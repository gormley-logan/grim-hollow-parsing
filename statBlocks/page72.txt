creature.
Hit: 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. The target’s hit
point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
necrotic damage taken. The reduction lasts until the
target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect
reduces its hit point maximum to 0. If a target dies, the
wisp regains 10 (4d4) hit points, gaining any excess as
temporary hit points.

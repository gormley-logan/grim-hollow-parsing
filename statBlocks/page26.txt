succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become

Each creature
within 20 feet of the blightwind must succeed on a DC
16 Strength saving throw or be pulled 20 feet straight
toward the blightwind. If a creature would enter another
creature’s space, both creatures instead take 3 (1d6)
bludgeoning damage and fall prone, each in the space
they were in before colliding. Creatures pulled into the
blightwind’s space take 14 (2d8 + 5) necrotic damage and
are subjected to Blight. A creature that fails the saving
throw against Blight is blinded while poisoned due to
that exposure to the trait.

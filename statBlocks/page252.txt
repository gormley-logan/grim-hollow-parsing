Coldfire Crisis.
As a bonus action, the panjaian
gormadraugon causes the area within a 30-foot
sphere centered on it to become icy difficult terrain.
Nonmagical flames in that area go out. Creatures of
the gormadraugon’s choice that start their turn in
that area lose their resistance to cold damage or treat
their cold immunity as resistance to cold damage.
This loss of resistance or immunity lasts until the start
of the creature’s next turn. The aura lasts until the
gormadraugon becomes incapacitated, dies, or uses an
action or bonus action to end it.
Ignite.
If a creature or a flammable object takes cold
damage from the panjaian gormadraugon, the target
ignites. Until the target is dealt fire damage, it takes 3
(1d6) cold damage at the start of each of its turns.
Innate Spellcasting.
The panjaian gormadraugon’s
innate spellcasting ability is Constitution (spell save DC
13). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no
material components: At will: faerie fire
1/day: wall of ice
Regeneration.
The panjaian gormadraugon regains
10 hit points at the start of its turn. If the gormadraugon
takes fire damage, this trait doesn’t function at the start
of the gormadraugon’s next turn. The gormadraugon
dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and
doesn’t regenerate.

When the panjaian gormadraugon
fails a saving throw, its skin flashes with prismatic scales,
it rerolls the saving throw, and it uses the higher roll. If
the reroll causes the save to succeed, creatures within
30 feet of the gormadraugon must succeed on a DC 13
Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of
their next turn.

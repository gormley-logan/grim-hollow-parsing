Boom Bloom
. One of the thunderblossom’s blooms
explodes with significant concussive force that can be heard
up to 150 feet away. Each other creature within 10 feet of
the thunderblossom must make a DC 11 Strength saving
throw or take 14 (4d6) thunder damage and deafened
until the end of its next turn. A creature that fails by 3 or
more is also stunned until the end of their next turn.
A creature that succeeds on this saving throw takes half
damage and is not deafened.

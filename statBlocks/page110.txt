Once on its turn, the
epachrach can use 20 feet of its movement to move magically
into one area of living plants within 5 feet of it and emerge
from an area of living plants within 60 feet of the first,
appearing in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the
second. The area of plants must be large enough to be the
epachrach’s space, although it can be solid, such as one
Huge tree. These plants can be animate creatures, such as
a treant, or magical, such as the plants the
entangle
spell
calls forth.
Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).
If the epachrach takes 30 damage or less that would reduce
it to 0 hit points, it is reduced to 1 hit point instead.
Siege Monster.
The epachrach deals double damage to
objects and structures.
Trampling Charge.
If the epachrach moves at least
20 feet straight toward a creature and then hits it with a
tusk attack on the same turn, that target must succeed on
a DC 18 Strength saving throw or fall prone. If the target
is prone, the epachrach can make one hooves attack
against it as a bonus action.

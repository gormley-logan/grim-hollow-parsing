Amorphous.
The amorphous horror can move through
a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Shapechanger.
The amorphous horror can use an
action or a bonus action to polymorph into a form that
resembles its Small or Medium humanoid appearance
before it became a horror. Its statistics are the same in
each form. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t
transformed. It reverts to its true Medium form if it dies.
actions
Multiattack.
The amorphous horror makes two
slam attacks.
Slam.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 9 (2d8)
acid damage.
reactions
Split.
When an amorphous horror that is Medium or
larger drops below half its hit points but has at least
10 hit points, it splits into two new horrors. Each new
horror has hit points equal to half the original horror’s,
rounded down. New horrors are one size smaller than
the original horror.

False Appearance. While the whipskein horror hides its
tendrils from sight, such as under clothing, it is indistin-
guishable from the ordinary humanoid it once was.
actions
Multiattack.
The whipskein horror makes four attacks.
Tendril.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target.
Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the target
is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape
DC 14). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained,
and the whipskein horror can’t use that tendril against
another target. The horror has four tendrils.
Spit.
Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 30 ft., one
target.
Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) poison damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or
become poisoned until the end of the whipskein horror’s
next turn. Being within 5 feet of a hostile creature doesn’t
impose disadvantage on the horror’s ranged attack rolls
with its spit.
Tendril Dance (Recharge 5–6).
The whipskein
horror extends and wriggles its tendrils, releasing any
creatures it has grappled. Each creature within 30 feet
of and able to see the horror must succeed on a DC 12
Wisdom saving throw or become charmed by the horror.
While charmed in this way, a creature is incapacitated
and has a speed of 0. The effect ends for a creature if it
takes damage, if another creature uses an action to shake
the creature out of its stupor, or the horror fails to take a
bonus action on its turn to continue the effect. The horror
can’t take that bonus action while using a tendril to
grapple another creature.
components for arcane necromancy or transmutation
spells equal to half the horror’s challenge challenge rating.
Each component is consumed when used to cast, but
the spell is cast as if the caster used a spell slot one level
higher, up to a maximum of a 5th-level slot.

a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 12 (2d8+3) fire
damage on a failure and taking half damage on a success.
Blood Boil.

take 9 (2d8) fire damage as its blood superheats. The
bloodbonded must be able to speak to use this ability.
reactions
Loyal Followers.
When a bloodbonded would take
damage from a melee or ranged attack it can see that targets
only the bloodbonded, it can use its reaction to call on one
of its followers within 5 feet to take the damage instead.

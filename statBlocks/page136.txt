Rampage Aura.
Each creature hostile to the rampage
gnoll and within 10 feet of it at the end of its turn must
make a DC 12 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the
creature uses its reaction to make a melee weapon attack
or use a melee spell attack cantrip against a target of the
gnoll’s choice. The gnoll can force the target to move up
to half its speed if necessary to make the attack. When
moving, the target avoids obviously dangerous areas
and provoking opportunity attacks if possible.
A creature who succeeds on the saving throw is immune
to the Rampage Aura of all rampage gnolls for 1 hour.
Instinctive.
The rampage gnoll has advantage on
initiative rolls and saving throws against being charmed
or frightened. If surprised, the gnoll can still act normally
on its first turn.
Rampage.
When the rampage gnoll reduces a creature
to 0 hit points with a melee attack on its turn, the gnoll
can take a bonus action to move up to half its speed and
make a bite attack.
Skilled Brute.
A weapon deals one extra die of its
damage when the rampage gnoll hits with it (included
in the attacks).

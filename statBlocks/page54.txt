Elemental Weakness.
The catacomb haunt has
vulnerability to one damage type from among (roll
1d10) 1–2 acid, 3–4 cold, 5–6 fire, 7–8 lightning, or 9–10
thunder. A creature can take an action to study a haunt,
gaining a clue to its vulnerability with a successful DC

check. If the haunt takes damage it has vulnerability to,
it loses its damage resistances, condition immunities
other than to poisoned, its Incorporeal Movement trait,
and its fly speed for 1 minute. The haunt ends this effect
on itself early with a successful DC 13 Constitution saving
throw, which it can make at the end of each of its turns.

take the Disengage action.

inside an object.

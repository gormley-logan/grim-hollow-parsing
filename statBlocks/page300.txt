actions
Peacemaking
. The bloodied targets up to four hostile
creatures it can see. Each must succeed on a DC 14 Charisma
saving throw or be charmed by the bloodied for one
minute. A creature charmed in this way is incapacitated
and begins weeping uncontrollably until another creature
uses its action to shake the creature out of it.
Shared Sacrifice
. The bloodied chooses an allied
creature within 30 feet of it. Until the end of the bloodied’s
next turn, the bloodied has resistance to all damage, and
whenever the bloodied takes damage, the target creature
takes damage equal to the damage dealt to the bloodied.
reactions
Ultimate End
. The bloodied targets a single creature
within 60 ft. that just attacked it. The target must succeed
a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or immediately take force
damage equal to the bloodied’s current hit point total
as the bloodied removes its chains. The bloodied dies
instantly. On a success, the target takes half as much
damage, and that damage cannot lower the target to less
than 1 hp.

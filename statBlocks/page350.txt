narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Amphibious.

False Appearance.

Infection.
Any non-ooze creature that starts its turn
within 10 feet of the ooze, or that touches the ooze, must
succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned until the start of its next turn. A creature that
fails the saving throw by 5 or more also contracts the
sewer plague. On a successful saving throw, the creature
is immune to any urban ooze’s Infection for 1 hour and
the disease it carries for 24 hours.

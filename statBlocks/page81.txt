Drink Light.
The dawndrinker can take a bonus action
to drink light within 30 feet of it. If it does so, nonmagical
light sources in this area go out, extinguishing any flames
that are the source of the light. Provided the light comes
from an effect of 3rd level or lower, or a creature of CR 7
or lower, magical bright light becomes dim light, and
magical dim light goes out. If a magical effect’s light is
extinguished, the effect is dispelled. A creature’s or object’s
inherent light returns to normal after 1 minute. The
dawndrinker can dim or extinguish stronger effects
by succeeding on a Constitution check with a DC of 10 +
the effect’s level or 5 + the creator’s CR, whichever is lower.
Light Sense.
The dawndrinker can sense any light
source within 120 feet of it. This sense penetrates most
barriers, but it is blocked by 3 feet of wood or dirt, 1 foot
of stone, or 1 inch of metal.
Radiant Absorption.
Whenever the dawndrinker is
subjected to radiant damage, it takes no damage and in-
stead regains hit points equal to the radiant damage dealt.
Shadow Cunning.
In dim light or darkness, the
dawndrinker can take a bonus action to use the
Disengage or Hide actions.

bugbear vampire customization
A bugbear vampire is stronger than others of its age,
having a higher Strength score and the Rampage trait—
see the stat block. The vampire relies on this brute force
and much less on reason and charm, so their Intelligence
and Charisma is often lower. Such vampires outgrow the
brashness of the spawn stage more slowly, and they’re
therefore often still chaotic evil. The vampire loves to
surprise foes, then fight, feed, and kill in an efficient
but brash manner. A bugbear vampire has the Clawing
Lunge, Reckless, and Surprise Mauling traits, as shown
in the stat block. As with many other creatures who have
darkvision in life, the bugbear vampire has darkvision
superior to that of typical vampires its age (add 30 feet).

As a bonus action, the wretched reveler
sings a catchy tune. One creature of the reveler’s choice
within 30 feet and able to hear the reveler must succeed on
a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be charmed until the
start of the reveler’s next turn. While charmed in this way,
the target uses its movement to dance in place without
leaving its space, causing disadvantage on attack rolls and
Dexterity saving throws. Other creatures have advantage
on attack rolls against the target while it dances.
The reveler can stop singing at any time, ending the
effect. This effect ends early if the reveler is incapacitated
or destroyed, or if the target can’t hear the song.

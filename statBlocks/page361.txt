Command Weeping Zombies.
The weeping lord can
direct weeping zombies it is aware of within 120 feet of
it, using a form of limited telepathy.
Innate Spellcasting.
The weeping lord’s innate
spellcasting ability is Constitution (spell save DC 13,
+5 to hit with spell attacks). It can innately cast the
following spells, requiring no components: At will: chill touch
(5th level)
3/day each: ray of sickness
,
shield
1/day: blindness/deafness
Magic Contagion.
A creature affected by the weeping
lord’s magic is also exposed to Weeping Pox.
Undead Fortitude.
If damage reduces the weeping
lord to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving
throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the
damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the
weeping zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
Weeping Pox.
A humanoid that comes within 5 feet of
the weeping lord must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or contract Weeping Pox. If a humanoid
succeeds on the saving throw, it’s immune to the disease
for 24 hours. A humanoid infected with the disease must
repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, increasing its
exhaustion level by one on a failure. This exhaustion
can’t be reduced until the disease is cured with magic.
Until the first level of exhaustion sets in, however,
the humanoid has sharpened senses. Whenever this
humanoid makes an ability check or saving throw
against anything other than the disease, they can roll
a d4 and add the number rolled. A slight fever and
overexcitement are the only signs this condition comes
from Weeping Pox.

Borrowed Blood.
The vampire has six d12s it can use
in place of Hit Dice to cast sangromancy spells. When the
vampire regains hit points due to using its bite, it regains
one of these d12s that it has used.
Evasion.
If the vampire is subjected to an effect that
allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
damage, the vampire instead takes no damage if it succeeds
on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
Forbiddance.
The vampire can enter a residence only
with an invitation from one of that home’s residents. If
the vampire enters a house uninvited and involuntarily,
it takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its
turns while it remains there.
Misty Step (Recharge 5–6).
As a bonus action, the
vampire disappears in shadowy mist and teleports up
to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
Relentless Blood (1/Day).
If damage reduces the
vampire to 0 hit points, it can make a Charisma saving
throw (DC 5 + the damage taken), unless the damage is
radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the vampire
drops to 1 hit point instead.

reactions
Horrifying Revelation.
When a creature within
30 feet of the vampire harms it, the vampire reveals a
ghastly distortion of its true form to the attacker. The
target must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw
or become frightened of the vampire for 1 minute. A
creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a
target’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for
it, it is immune to this vampire’s Horrifying Revelation
for 24 hours.

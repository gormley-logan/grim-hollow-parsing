Aim
. The dark mist stalker selects one target it can see
and spends its turn focusing its aim on the target, as if
concentrating on a spell. While doing so creatures have
advantage to hit the dark mist stalker. The dark mist
stalker’s next hunting bow attack against that target has
advantage and deals an extra 27 (6d8) piercing damage.
If its concentration is broken before its next attack, the
dark mist stalker loses the benefits of aim.

5 feet of the dark mist stalker, it can make a skinning
knife attack and move 20 feet without provoking an
opportunity attack.

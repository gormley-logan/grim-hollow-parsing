DC 15 Intelligence (Medicine): The repeated
failures and deaths during the search for a cure for the
Weeping Pox led to a new epidemic of unhinged magical
alchemists. Some still seek to ply their trade, curing
whatever sicknesses they come across. Others now see
life itself as a disease in need of a cure.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): Inured to disease
and suffering, some former physicians turned their
alchemical concoctions to combat uses. They can heal
themselves and throw volatile magical grenades that can
afflict foes with disease symptoms.

Supernaturally Sharp
. Skinweaver’s tanning
knives overcome slashing damage resistance (though
not immunity).
Shocking Visage
. Any humanoid that starts its turn
within 30 feet of the skinweaver and can see it must
make a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save,
the creature is frightened until the end of the creature’s
next turn). Whether a creature succeeds or fails, it cannot
be affected by this ability again until it loses sight of the
skinweaver (as when the skinweaver moves behind total
cover or successfully hides).

Amphibious.
The bog crawler can breathe air and water.
Slimy Movement.
The bog crawler ignores difficult
terrain, and magical effects can’t reduce its speed or
cause it to be restrained. It can spend 5 feet of movement
to escape from nonmagical restraints or being grappled.
actions
Multiattack.
The bog crawler makes two tentacle attacks,
or one tentacle attack and one bite or swallow.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
Hit: 34 (4d12 + 8) piercing damage, and the target
is grappled (escape DC 21). Until this grapple ends,
the target is restrained, and the bog crawler can’t bite
another target.
Tentacle.
Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 20 ft., one
creature.
Hit: 26 (4d8 + 8) bludgeoning damage, and the
target is grappled (escape DC 21). Until the grapple ends,
the target is restrained. The bog crawler has six tentacles,
each of which can grapple one target.
Swallow.
The bog crawler makes one bite attack against
a Huge or smaller creature it holds grappled with its
bite. If the attack hits, the target takes the bite’s damage,
the grapple ends, and the target is swallowed. While
swallowed, a creature is blinded and restrained, has
total cover against anything originating outside the bog
crawler, and takes 36 (8d8) acid damage at the start of each
of the bog crawler’s turns.
If the bog crawler takes 30 damage or more on a single
turn from a creature inside it, the bog crawler must succeed
on a DC 21 Constitution saving throw at the end of that
turn or regurgitate all swallowed creatures, which fall
prone in spaces within 10 feet of the bog crawler. If the bog
crawler dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained
by it and can escape the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement,
exiting prone.

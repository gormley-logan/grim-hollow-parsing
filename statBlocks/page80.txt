Hit
: 4 (1d4 + 2) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw,
taking 18 (4d8) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. If this poison damage
reduces the target to 0 hit points, the target is stable, but
even if the target regains hit points, the target is poisoned
for 1 hour and paralyzed while poisoned in this way.

Soul Drain
.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one creature.
Hit: 7 (2d4 + 3) necrotic damage, and the
target must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw.
On a failure, the target’s available Hit Dice are reduced
by 1. If this effect reduces the target’s Hit Dice to 0, the
target falls unconscious. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, regaining
consciousness on a success. Hit Dice lost this way return
at the end of a short rest, in time to spend them to
regain hit points.
If an oblivion leaper kills a living creature with this
attack when the creature is at 0 Hit Dice, the target’s soul
is lost to the realm of shadow. This lost soul can be raised
from the dead only with mighty magic, such as
wish
or
divine intervention.

until the start of its next turn and unable to hide the
distress of hearing the whistling, which is the source
of the fear and considered to be within line of sight
while the target can hear and is within 30 feet of it. On a
successful saving throw, the creature is immune to any

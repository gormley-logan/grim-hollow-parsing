As a bonus action, the eagal

Innate Spellcasting.

(17th level, can be telepathic)

actions
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
Hit: 3 (1d6) piercing damage plus 7 (3d4)
psychic damage, and a humanoid target must succeed
on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by
the eagal sithe for 24 hours. The charmed target regards
the eagal sithe as a trusted friend to be heeded and
protected, taking the eagal sithe’s requests or actions
in the most favorable way.
If the eagal sithe or its allies harm the target, it can
repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success.
Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the eagal
sithe dies, is on a different plane than the target, or takes
a bonus action to end the effect.
Emotional Torment.
One charmed creature within
60 feet of the eagal sithe must make a DC 14 Charisma
saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) psychic damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
A target that fails the saving throw feels despair and has
disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls until the
end of the eagal sithe’s next turn.

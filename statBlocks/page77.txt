actions
Multiattack.
The daemon oak makes two lash attacks,
or it makes one lash attack and uses spew.
Lash.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one
target.
Hit: 20 (4d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage. If the target is
a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 18)
and restrained while grappled in this way. The daemon
oak can grapple up to four creatures at a time.
Rock.
Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, range 60/180 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 32 (4d12 + 6) bludgeoning damage.
Spew (Recharge 5–6).
One of the daemon oak’s mouths
spews a 30-foot cone of acidic ichor. Each creature in that
area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking
18 (4d8) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
Tree Thrall (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).
The daemon oak curses and animates one tree
within 30 feet of it. Such a tree becomes a daemon oak
thrall. This thrall is the daemon oak’s ally, and it takes
its turn just after the daemon oak. The thrall obeys the
daemon oak’s verbal commands (no action for the daemon
oak). If issued no commands, the thrall attacks a creature
that isn’t the thrall’s ally. A thrall dies after 24 hours,
when the daemon oak uses a bonus action to sever the
connection to the thrall, the thrall is more than 1 mile
from the daemon oak, or the daemon oak dies.
reactions
Chain.
When a creature within 10 feet of the daemon
oak attempts to move from it’s current position, the
daemon oak can make a lash attack against that creature.

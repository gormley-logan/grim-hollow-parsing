creatures mutatedbythe beast
Simply being in the proximity of the Great Beast causes
gruesome and dangerous mutations in creatures. Some
creatures—such as hurrocks, gnolls, and caprathorns, for
example—are specifically spawned, changed, or created
by interactions with the Beast.
For other creatures, however, their mutations are more
random. Use the following table to create unique creatures
that have fallen prey to the Beast’s mutative powers. Also
feel free to create your own using these as guides: beast mutations

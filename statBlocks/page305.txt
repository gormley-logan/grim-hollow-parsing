reactions
Shriek.
When the shrieking mandrake emerges from
the ground, it emits a shriek audible within 120 feet of
it. Each creature within 10 feet of and able to hear the
mandrake when it shrieks must succeed on a DC 10
Wisdom saving throw or take 5 (2d4) psychic damage.
A creature that fails by 5 or more is also deafened
for 1 minute. A deafened target can make a DC 10
Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

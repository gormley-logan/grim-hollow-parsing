Keen Hearing.
The swarm of ears has advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing.
Pain Transfer.
When the swarm takes damage and
creatures charmed by it are in its space, divide the
damage in half. The swarm takes one half, and the other
half is divided among creatures charmed by the swarm
in its space.
Sound Dependent.
While deafened, the swarm
of ears can’t use its blindsight, and creatures have
advantage on saving throws against the swarm’s
Overwhelming Whispers.
Swarm.
The swarm of ears can occupy another creature’s
space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through
any opening large enough for a Tiny creature. The swarm
can’t regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
Waxy Discharge.
The swarm’s space is covered with
viscous wax that dries quickly as the swarm moves. This
area is difficult terrain for creatures other than swarms of
ears and creatures charmed by them.
actions
Overwhelming Whispers.
Each creature in the
swarm’s space must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving
throw or take 22 (4d10) psychic damage, or 11 (2d10)
psychic damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or
fewer, and become charmed until the start of the swarm’s
next turn by the whispers coming from the movement
of the ears. A creature charmed in this way must use its
reaction to move with the swarm, remaining in its space
if possible. Any movement a creature uses during this
reaction can’t be used during the creature’s turn.
Sacrifice.
If the swarm of ears is in the kokela’s space,
the swarm can destroy itself. The kokela regains hit
points equal to the swarm’s current hit points when it
uses this action.

Briar Patch (Recharge 6)
. Thorny vines sprout from
the ground in a 20-foot square starting from a point within
5 feet of the braerog. The briar patch is difficult terrain
and lasts for 1 minute, until the braerog creates another
patch, until the braerog uses a bonus action to dismiss the
patch, or until the braerog becomes incapacitated or dies.
The braerog can designate creatures immune to the vines
when creating the patch. Any other creature that enters
the area or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 11
Strength saving throw or be grappled by the thorny vines
(escape DC 11) and restrained while grappled in this way.

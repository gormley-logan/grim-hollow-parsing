Keen Hearing and Smell.
The hungerer wolf has
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on

Pack Tactics.
The hungerer wolf has advantage on
attack rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolf’s
allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally
isn’t incapacitated.
Tears of the Hungerer.
A beast or humanoid that
takes damage from the hungerer wolf must succeed on a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract Tears of the
Hungerer, a magical disease. If a creature succeeds on
the saving throw, it’s immune to the disease for 24 hours.
A creature infected with the disease decreases its hit
point maximum by 2 (1d4) every 24 hours. If this disease
reduces the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target
dies and becomes a zombie that also has this trait. This
magical disease can be cured only with magic.

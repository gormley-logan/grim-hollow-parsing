Evasion.
If the vampire is subjected to an effect that
allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half
damage, the vampire instead takes no damage if it succeeds
on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.
Feeding Frenzy.
When the vampire regains hit points
from using its bite, it has advantage on its attack rolls
until the end of its next turn.
Forbiddance.
The vampire can enter a residence only
with an invitation from one of that home’s residents. If
the vampire enters a house uninvited and involuntarily,
it takes 1d10 psychic damage at the end of each of its
turns while it remains there.
Misty Step (Recharge 5–6).
As a bonus action, the
vampire disappears in shadowy mist and teleports up to
30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.
Sunlight Inability.
The vampire has disadvantage on
attack rolls and ability checks while in direct sunlight.
actions
Multiattack.
The vampire attacks twice with its
longsword and once with its bite.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage, and the target
must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or
take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage. The vampire regains hit
points equal to the necrotic damage the target takes.
Longsword.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3)
slashing damage if used with two hands.
reactions
Horrifying Revelation.
When a creature within 30 feet
of the vampire harms it, the vampire reveals a ghastly
distortion of its true form to the attacker. The target must
succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened of the vampire for 1 minute. A creature can
repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target’s saving
throw is successful or the effect ends for it, it is immune
to this vampire’s Horrifying Revelation for 24 hours.

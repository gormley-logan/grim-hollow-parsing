actions
Multiattack.
The infernal tormentor makes two
greatsword attacks. It can use infernal leash in place of
one attack.
Greatsword.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 11 (2d6 +4) slashing damage and 7 (2d6)
fire damage.
Infernal Leash (Recharge 6).
A flaming whip
appears in the infernal tormentor’s hand or from its
greatsword and lashes at a creature the tormentor can
see within 30 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC
13 Charisma saving throw. A creature that has signed
a fiendish contract has disadvantage on this save. On a
failure, the creature takes 14 (4d6) fire damage, is pulled
10 feet closer to the tormentor, and is cursed for 1 minute
or until the tormentor uses this action again. This curse
also ends if the target enters hallowed ground.
While cursed, the target can’t move more than 30 feet
from the tormentor. Also while the curse lasts, the target
takes 7 (2d6) extra fire damage from the tormentor’s great-
sword attacks. The tormentor can use a bonus action to
move the target 10 feet to an unoccupied space within
30 feet of the tormentor. If this space is dangerous, the
target receives a new saving throw before moving, ending
the effect on itself on a success.

Infernal Brand (Recharge 6).
As a bonus action,
the infernal contractor chooses one creature it can see
within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 13
Charisma saving throw or become cursed for 1 minute.
A creature that has signed a contract with the contractor
has disadvantage on this save. When the cursed creature
makes an ability check, attack roll, or a saving throw, the
target must roll a d6 and subtract the number rolled from
the result. The creature can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on
a success. The effect also ends if the contractor uses this
trait again or the target enters hallowed ground.

Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage and 4 (1d8) fire damage.
Locate Signee.
The infernal contractor can sense
the direction to any creature that has signed one of its
contracts, provided that creature is on the same plane of
existence. If the creature is moving, the contractor knows
the direction of its movement. Effects that protect the
target from divination work against this action.
reactions
Infernal Luck
. When a creature within 30 feet of the
infernal contractor makes an ability check, attack roll,
or saving throw against the contractor, the contractor
can force that creature to reroll. The target must use
the lower of the two rolls. A creature affected by this
reaction is immune to the Infernal Luck of this infernal
contractor for 24 hours.
of mortal souls bound to it by contracts. Sometimes, the
terms of such an agreement involve the mortal becoming a
fiend itself, so a powerful fiend might have any number of
lesser devils serving under it via contract.
DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana): Fiends are natives of the
Netherworld, and any fiend slain returns to that plane
to reconstitute itself. Only powerful divine magic can
banish a fiend permanently. Uttering a devil’s true name,
however, grants the speaker power over it.

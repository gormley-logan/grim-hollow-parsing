Giant Brute.
A melee or thrown weapon deals one
extra die of its damage when the putrid giant hits with it
(included in the attacks).
Pox Euphoria.
With its ability checks other than
Intelligence checks and saving throws other than
Constitution saves, the putrid giant rolls 1d4 and adds
the number rolled to the result.
Weeping Pox.
A humanoid that comes within 5 feet
of the putrid giant or anything it has recently held
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or
contract Weeping Pox. If a humanoid succeeds on the
saving throw, it’s immune to the disease for 24 hours.
A humanoid infected with the disease must repeat the
saving throw every 24 hours, increasing its exhaustion
level by one on a failure. This exhaustion can’t be
reduced until the disease is cured. The disease can be
cured only with magic.
Until the first level of exhaustion sets in, however,
the humanoid has sharpened senses and a sense of
wellbeing. Whenever this humanoid makes an ability
check or saving throw against anything other than the
disease, they can roll a d4 and add the number rolled
to the ability check or saving throw. A slight fever and
overexcitement are the only signs this condition comes
from Weeping Pox.

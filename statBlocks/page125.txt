Keen Hearing and Smell.
The fzeg has advantage on
Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or smell.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day).
If the fzeg fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
Rampage.
When the fzeg reduces a creature to 0 hit points
with a melee attack on its turn, the fzeg can take a bonus
action to move up to half its speed and make a bite attack.
Regeneration.
The fzeg regains 20 hit points at the
start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point. If the fzeg
takes radiant damage, this trait doesn’t function at the
start of the fzeg’s next turn.
Shapechanger.
The fzeg can use its action to
polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid or back
into its true form, that of a wolf-humanoid hybrid. It can
transform its body parts as part of attacking with them
and can choose whether the change remains after making
the attack. Other than its size, its statistics are the same in
each form. Any equipment it’s wearing or carrying isn’t
transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
Spider Climb.
The fzeg can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to
make an ability check.
actions
Multiattack.
The fzeg uses its howl, then attacks once
with its bite and twice with its claws.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage plus 17 (5d6)
necrotic damage and is stunned until the end of its
next turn. A humanoid slain after being bitten rises the
following night as a fzeglaich under the fzeg’s control.
Claws.
Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.
Howl.
Each creature of the fzeg’s choice that is within
300 feet of the fzeg and able to hear it must succeed on a
DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
If a creature’s saving throw is successful or the effect ends
for it, the creature is immune to the fzeg’s Howl for the
next 24 hours or until it is stunned by the fzeg.
Night Children (Recharges after a Short or
Long Rest).
The fzeg magically calls eight wolves.
These wolves arrive in 2 rounds, acting as allies of the
fzeg and obeying its spoken commands. The beasts
remain for 1 hour, until the fzeg dies, or until the fzeg
dismisses them as a bonus action.
legendary actions
The fzeg can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from
the options here. Only one legendary action option
can be used at a time and only at the end of another
creature’s turn. The fzeg regains spent legendary
actions at the start of its turn.
Move.
The fzeg moves up to its speed without
provoking opportunity attacks.
Claws.
The fzeg attacks with its claws.
Incite.
The fzeg chooses one creature that is of a lower
Challenge, has a bite attack, and is within 60 feet of the
fzeg. Provided the target can see or hear the fzeg, that
creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed
and make a bite attack.
Bite (Costs 2 Actions).
The fzeg attacks with its bite.

Shared Life.
Each of the wolfentroikas in a trio shares
life. If the wolfentroika starts its turn with 0 hit points and
within 100 feet of another member of its trio that has 1 or
more hit points, the wolfentroika regains 1 hit point. If a
wolfentroika is at 0 hit points and one or more members
of its trio is alive, the wolfentroika can die only if its body
is destroyed in such a way that only the
true resurrection
spell or similarly powerful magic could restore it to life.
Shared Mind.
Each of the wolfentroikas in a trio shares
consciousness. While within 100 feet of one another, if
one wolfentroika is aware of something, all three are.
The wolfentroika can be blinded, charmed, deafened,
frightened, incapacitated, paralyzed, petrified, stunned,
or knocked unconscious only if the other two succumb
to the same condition at the same time or are more
than 100 feet from the wolfentroika. When one wolfen-
troika recovers from one of these conditions or moves
within 100 feet of an affected sibling, each other trio
member within 100 feet recovers.
Trio Tactics.
The wolfentroika has advantage on attack
rolls against a creature if at least one of the wolfentroika’s
trio is within 5 feet of the creature.

can die. Similarly, the three resist magic that can only
affect one or two of them.

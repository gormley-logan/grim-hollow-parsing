The eater can use a bonus action to
take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.

oid’s eye, the eater can apply its proficiency bonus to
any Charisma check to impersonate that person. If the
proficiency bonus already applies, apply it again, up to
doubling the bonus.
Fiendish Precision.
When the eater doesn’t have
disadvantage on a melee weapon attack roll and hits the
target, the eater deals 3 extra dice of the weapon’s damage
(included in actions).
Fiendish Sight.
Magical darkness doesn’t impede the
eater’s darkvision.
Shapechanger.
The eater can use its action to polymorph
into a humanoid whose eye the eater last ate or back into
the eater’s true form. Its statistics are the same in each form.
Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn’t transformed.
The eater reverts to its true form if it dies.

Rapier
.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit
: 7 (1d8 + 3) piercing damage, and if the eater doesn’t have disadvantage on the attack roll, the attack
deals an aditional 13 (3d8) piercing damage. If the eater
scores a critical hit, the eater can extract one of the
target’s eyes.
Eat Eye.
The eater consumes an eye that was extracted
from a living humanoid no more than 1 minute before,
regaining 25 hit points. The eater can then polymorph
into that person, per Shapechanger, as part of this action.
reactions
Uncanny Dodge
. When an attacker the eater can see
hits the eater with an attack, the eater can use its reaction
to halve the attack’s damage to the eater.
gms advice: Any humanoid creature that might serve a
warlock can be turned into an eater of orbs by giving them
the ability to extract eyes and then change shape after
eating them.  An eaten eye would heal 5 hit points per CR.

False Appearance.
The spythronar sac appears to be
a tangled ball of string, twigs, and dirt. Someone who
can see the sac can identify it with a successful DC 15
Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) check.
Fragile.
A creature who enters the spythronar sac’s
space must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw,
or the sac is destroyed.
Lightning Release.
When the spythronar sac is
destroyed, it releases lightning in a 10-foot radius. A
creature who destroyed the sac by entering its space
receives no saving throw. Other creatures in that area
must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or
take 4 (1d8) lightning damage. Each spythronar swarm
and web in this area instead gains advantage on its
next attack roll.
Shocking Birth.
When a spythronar sac takes lightning
damage from a source other than another spythronar,
it hatches, transforming into a spythronar swarm with
half the normal hit points. This swarm rolls initiative and
enters the combat.

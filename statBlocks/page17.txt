Etharis. She is an imposing dragonborn, covered in
golden scales and rarely seen without her flaming
longsword, Heretic’s End. She has a stern demeanor
and an unflinching faith in the ideology and goals of the

her authority as warden of the cathedral, she considers
it her personal duty to ensure they never threaten others
with their corruption again.

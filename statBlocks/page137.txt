Gruesome Deluge.
Melee Weapon Attack

Medium size or smaller must succeed on a DC 15 Strength
saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15).
Grisly Mire.
Each creature grappled by the gore elemental
must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw. On a failure,
a target takes 15 (2d10+4) slashing damage plus 5 (2d4)
necrotic damage and is knocked prone. Until it escapes
from the gore elementalâ€™s grapple, the target is blinded,
restrained, and unable to breathe. If the saving throw is
successful, the target is pushed to an adjacent space.
reactions
Swelling Crimson (1/Day).
If the gore elemental reduces
a living creature to 0 hit points, its size increases to Huge.
The elemental gains advantage on all Strength and
Constitution saving throws, the gruesome deluge attack
can now grapple Large creatures, and the grisly mire attack
now deals 10 (4d4 + 4) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic
damage on a failed saving throw. This condition lasts until
the gore elemental is reduced to less than 55 hit points.

It can use soul shards to cast an innate spell it can’t
normally cast again on a given day by spending soul
shards equal to the level of the spell, as noted in the
Innate Spellcasting trait.
actions
Multiattack.
The malefic broker uses mindfire twice
and puppeteer once.
Mindfire.
Melee or Ranged Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach
5 ft. or range 30/60 ft., one creature.
Hit: 13 (3d8) fire
damage and 13 (3d8) psychic damage, and the target
ignites. Until a creature takes an action to douse the fire,
the target takes 4 (1d8) fire damage and 4 (1d8) psychic
damage at the start of each of its turns.
Puppeteer.
The malefic broker chooses one creature it
can see within 120 feet of it. The target benefits from any
protection it has against being charmed. The target must
succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or the malefic
broker can immediately force the target to use its reaction
to make an attack or use a cantrip against a target of the
broker’s choice. If the target is ignited by Mindfire, and
the attack or cantrip deals damage, the target takes that
effect’s normal damage plus 4 (1d8) fire damage and 4
(1d8) psychic damage.
reactions
Soul Siphon.
If a living creature dies within 30 feet of
the malefic broker, the fiend gains one soul shard.

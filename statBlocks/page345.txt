Eye Crow
Popular Birds.
Eye crows are big corvids plentiful
throughout Etharis. They mimic sounds and voices, and
they’re extremely clever, remembering faces, locations,
and how other creatures treat them. People keep eye
crows as pets and often use their iridescent black feathers,
which have a deep-green sheen, to decorate.
Eye Eaters.
Eye crows have a strong inclination to eat
eyes, especially those of humanoids. A murder of these
birds is bold enough to attack a person directly. They
coordinate and communicate noisily as they chase prey.

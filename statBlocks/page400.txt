laneshi vampire customization
Laneshi vampires retain the swim speed of their living kin,
and the undead state enhances their darkvision. Vampire
blood brings out the long laneshi tradition of hit-and-run
fighting styles in the Skirmisher trait. Running water
doesn’t harm a laneshi vampire, and they have resistance
to the radiant damage holy water deals. A laneshi’s bite
drains moisture—see the Bite attack—and the vampire
must regularly immerse in water or feed to stave off deadly
dehydration. See the Water Reliance trait

a puck’s lair
Soil within a puck’s lair occasionally twinkles as if filled
with sparkling fertilizer. Many of the trees and plants are
likely to be the puck’s thralls, and allied plant creatures
might also dwell there. Within the lair, only creatures of
the puck’s choice leave tracks. Tracking such creatures is
possible only with magic.
A puck makes their hidden home in small crevices
beneath the interlaced roots of plant thralls. These roots
act as labyrinthine hallways connecting all parts of the
grove, which the puck uses to sneak around. While
hidden in this maze, the puck whispers to the trees and
telepathically commands them. Hiding and commanding
the plants to protect the puck is crucial, for it knows that
despite its great power, it is physically frail.
lair actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), while the
puck is inside its grove, it can take a lair action to cause
one of the following effects. A puck can’t use the same
effect two rounds in a row: •
Six images of the puck appear in multiple locations
in the lair, each moving and speaking independently
during the puck’s turn. At the start and end of
the puck’s turn, and one time during the puck’s
movement, it can teleport to the location of one of
these images. The images remain until initiative count
20 on the next round.

Tremor Aura
. As a bonus action, the quake drake can
activate an aura that shakes the earth within 20 feet of
itself. A creature in the aura standing on the ground at
the start of its turn must succeed on a DC 16 Dexterity
saving throw or fall prone. Quake drakes are immune to
this affect.
Charging Furrow
. If the quake drake burrows at least
10 feet in a straight line toward a target and hits with
a bite attack, the attack does an extra 14 (4d6) thunder
damage. The target is caught in rubble in their current
location and considered restrained until it uses as action to
succeed on a DC 16 Strength (Athletics) check to free itself.

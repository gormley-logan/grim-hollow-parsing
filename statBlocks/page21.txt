Pack Tactics.
The pox dog has advantage on an attack
roll against a creature if at least one of the dog’s allies is
within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn’t incapacitated.
Weeping Pox.
A humanoid that comes within 5 feet
of the pox dog must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution
saving throw or contract Weeping Pox. If a humanoid
succeeds on the saving throw, it’s immune to the disease
for 24 hours. A humanoid infected with the disease must
repeat the saving throw every 24 hours, increasing its
exhaustion level by one on a failure. This exhaustion
can’t be reduced until the disease is cured. The disease
can be cured only with magic.
Until the first level of exhaustion sets in, however,
the humanoid has sharpened senses and a sense of
wellbeing. Whenever this humanoid makes an ability
check or saving throw against anything other than the
disease, they can roll a d4 and add the number rolled
to the ability check or saving throw. A slight fever and
overexcitement are the only signs this condition comes
from Weeping Pox.

Seven Shades of Sitri.
A humanoid who touches a
Sitri cat must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving
throw or become infected with the Seven Shades of
Sitri. If a humanoid succeeds on the saving throw,
they’re immune to the disease for 24 hours. Carnal
urges overwhelm an infected humanoid. When the
infected interacts with another non-hostile humanoid,
the infected becomes charmed by that humanoid until
the subject of the infatuation or their friends harm the
infected. The infected can repeat the saving throw once
every 24 hours. Current infatuations end when one of
these saves succeeds. The disease ends for the infected
when they have succeeded on five saving throws.

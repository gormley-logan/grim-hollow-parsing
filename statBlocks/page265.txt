of which can be a bite.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one

Hit
: 14 (4d6) fire damage. Control Flame.
The troll chooses a fire it can see within
30 feet of it and expands that fire by one 5-foot cube,
extinguishes fire in one 5-foot cube, or makes shapes in
the fire in one 5-foot cube. Expanded fire needs fuel to
continue burning.
Firebane (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).
The troll spits fire at a point it can see within 120 feet of
it, and the fire bursts into an explosion of magical flame.
It ignites flammable objects that aren’t being worn or
carried. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered
on that point must make DC14 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failure, the target takes 28 (8d6) fire damage, and
for 1 minute, the target is cursed and must roll a 1d4 and
subtract the number rolled from attack rolls or saving
throw. If the save succeeds, the target takes half the fire
damage and isn’t cursed.

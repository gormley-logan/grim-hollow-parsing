The troll creates a 30-foot-radius sphere of fog
centered on itself. The sphere spreads around corners,
and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or
until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10
miles per hour) disperses it.
The troll can choose to make this fog caustic. If it does
so, a creature that enters the fog for the first time on a
turn or starts its turn there takes 10 (4d4) acid damage.
Once the troll makes caustic fog, it can do so again only
after it finishes a short or long rest.

dragonborn vampirecustomization
A dragonborn vampire retains an edge in Strength
compared to their peers. Also, the vampire has the
resistance and breath weapon their draconic ancestry
grants. Use the vampire’s Hit Dice as their level for
the damage the breath deals. However, the breath also
deals necrotic damage equal to that the vampire’s bite
deals. This necrotic damage neither reduces a target’s
hit point maximum nor causes the vampire to regain hit
points. Vampirism accentuates the predator aspects of
a dragonborn’s draconic ancestry, and so their breath
recharges more quickly their of living counterparts. A
dragonborn vampire also has the Brutal Attacks trait.

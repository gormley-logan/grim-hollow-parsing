gnome vampire customization
Gnome vampires are Small, with a speed of 25 feet, and
often weaker than other vampires (lower Strength). But
they’re just as agile and vicious—their attacks are just as
accurate and damaging—and they can have more cunning
(higher Intelligence). When converting the Hit Dice to
d6s for a Small creature, keep the hit point maximum
as close to the same as possible. A gnome vampire has
enhanced darkvision (add 30 feet) and retains the resilient
mind of a gnome, having Turn Resistance and proficiency
in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws.
Gnome vampires also have the Speak with Beasts trait,
and those young and older gnome vampires that can
speak with beasts have the Command Beast action. An-
cient gnome vampires can command five or more beasts
with one action.

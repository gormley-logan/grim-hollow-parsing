Multiattack.
The seraph makes three attacks, only one
of which can be a bite.
Bite
.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit
: 24 (3d12 + 5) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) radiant damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is
grappled (escape DC 18). Until this grapple ends, the target
is restrained, and the seraph can’t bite another target.
Claw.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit
: 12 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage and 9 (2d8) radiant damage.
Tongue.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 20 ft.,
one creature.
Hit: 10 (2d4 + 5) bludgeoning damage and 9
(2d8) radiant damage, and the target is grappled (escape
DC 18) and pulled to within 5 feet of the seraph. Until
the grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the seraph
can’t use its tongue or bite on another target.
Swallow.
The seraph makes one bite attack against
a Medium or smaller creature it holds grappled. If the
attack hits, the target takes the bite’s damage, the grapple
ends, and the target is swallowed. While swallowed, a
creature is blinded and restrained, has total cover against
anything originating outside the seraph, and takes 18 (4d8)
acid damage and 9 (2d8) radiant damage at the start of
each of the seraph’s turns. The seraph can have only one
creature swallowed at a time.
If the seraph takes 35 damage or more on a single turn
from a creature inside it, the seraph must succeed on a
DC 20 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn
or regurgitate the swallowed creature, which falls prone
in a space within 10 feet of the seraph. If the seraph dies,
the swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and
can escape the corpse by using 10 feet of movement,
exiting prone.

Slam.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit
: 8 (2d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage and 5 (2d4) piercing damage.
Suture Whip.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +6 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit
: 8 (2d4 + 3) slashing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is
grappled (escape DC 14) and pulled to within 5 feet
of the suture golem, and the suture golem can’t use its
suture whip on another target until the grapple ends.
If the golem hits the creature again while it’s already
grappled by the suture whip, the grapple ends, and
the creature is pulled into the golem’s space, sutured
to the golem, and restrained. A creature restrained in
this way moves with the golem, which can move at its
full speed while restraining one creature or at half its
speed while restraining two. A creature restrained by
the golem can escape as if from the original grapple but
has disadvantage to do so. If the golem is destroyed,
creatures are no longer restrained by it.

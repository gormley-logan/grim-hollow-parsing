hit points equal to that amount. The reduction lasts
until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this
effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

points. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or become restrained for 1 minute. The
target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of
its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

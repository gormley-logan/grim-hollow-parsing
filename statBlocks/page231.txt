Magic Resistance.
The mukad has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Spider Climb.
The mukad can climb difficult surfaces,
including upside down on ceilings, without needing to
make an ability check.
Tunneler.
The mukad can burrow through solid rock
at half its burrowing speed. When it burrows, it leaves a
10-foot-diameter tunnel in its wake.
actions
Multiattack.
The mukad makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 12 (2d8 + 3) piercing damage and 9 (2d8) poison
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a
DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned
for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at
the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself
on a success. If the creature drops to 0 hit points while
poisoned in this way, it becomes stable, but it is poisoned
for 1 hour and paralyzed while poisoned in this way.
Claws.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target.
Hit
: 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. Aetheric Blast (Recharge 6).
The mukad unleashes a
burst of psionic dissonance in a 60-foot cone. The effect goes
around corners. Each non-aberration in the area must make
a DC 13 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, a creature
takes 18 (3d10 + 2) psychic damage and is incapacitated for
1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end
of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
If the save succeeds, the creature takes half as much psychic
damage and isn’t incapacitated.
Aetheric Incubation.
The mukad injects a paralyzed
creature with a powerful psychic substance. The target
must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw
or become paralyzed for 24 hours. Over this time, an
ectoplasmic substance harmlessly encases the creature.
Removing the ectoplasm takes 1 minute, and “escaping”
from it takes no effort. If the ectoplasm remains for
13 (3d8) hours, 1d4 + the creature’s Intelligence bonus
mukad larvae appear on the creature, absorbing the
ectoplasm “cocoon.” These larvae attack the paralyzed
creature, feeding on it.

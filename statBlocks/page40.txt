Disguised Appearance.
While the bloody avenue
remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal
roadway. Other creatures can occupy the avenue’s space
while it remains motionless. A creature who uses an
action to examine the roadway and succeeds on a DC
15 Intelligence (Arcana or Investigation) check spots the
blood-tinged mortar with bits of bone and tiny runes on the
cobbles, which can give the nature of the avenue away.
Mire.
The ground within 40 feet of the bloody avenue is
difficult terrain for creatures of the avenue’s choice. Such
a creature that enters that area for the first time on a turn
or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 17 Strength
saving throw or become grappled by the ground (escape
DC 17). A creature that fails by 5 or more is restrained
while grappled in this way.
Rise.
On the bloody avenue’s first turn, as it acts, it takes
a serpentine form. When it does, each other creature in
its space must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.
On a failure, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied
space within 5 feet of the avenue and knocked prone. If
the save succeeds, the creature can choose the space it is
pushed into and doesn’t fall prone.

reactions
Alarum (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).

1 mile. That creature receives a telepathic image of the
reason the avenue sent the alert.

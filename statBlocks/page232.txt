Shadow Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
Hit: 13 (3d8) necrotic damage. If the target
is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC
12) by its shadow. Until this grapple ends, the nacambra
can’t bite another target. However, the nacambra can use
a bonus action to bite the grappled target.
Tail Whip.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 9 (3d4 + 2) slashing damage and the target
must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be
poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the
target can’t regain hit points. The target can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the
effect on itself on a success.
Shadow Shroud.
Provided it’s in dim light or darkness,
the nacambra magically turns invisible until it attacks
or until its concentration ends (as if concentrating on a
spell). Any equipment the nacambra wears or carries is
invisible with it.

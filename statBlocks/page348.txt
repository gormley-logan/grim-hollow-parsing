Ormwurm
Burrowing Carnivores
. Ormwurms are big lizards with
red, green, or tan scaly skin, a serpentine body, and two
strong arms. They slither as they move, using their arms to
help them climb. An ormwurm can sacrifice its tail to get
away from a predator. The tail eventually grows back.
These burrowers live along riverbanks or on sandy
beaches. They hunt larger animals, including cattle,
and they eat carrion. An ormwurm pulls its prey
underground to eat.

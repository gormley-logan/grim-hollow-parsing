Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) piercing damage and 2 (1d4)
necrotic damage.
Constrict.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 10 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage. If the
target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (escape DC
12). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and
the gripper can’t constrict another target.
Spores (1/Day).
The gripper spews spores in a 5-foot-
radius sphere centered on it, or if the gripper is dead, in
a 10-foot-radius sphere. The spores go around corners.
Each creature in the spores when they appear or that
enters them for the first time on a turn must make a DC
10 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature
takes 5 (2d4) necrotic damage and is incapacitated from
pain until the end of its next turn. On a successful saving
throw, the creature is immune to being incapacitated by
the spores of all grippers for 1 hour. The spores last until
the end of the gripper’s next turn, but a moderate or
stronger wind disperses them immediately.

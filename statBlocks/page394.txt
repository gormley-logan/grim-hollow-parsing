elf vampire customization
As shown in the following stats, young and older elf
vampires gain Turn Resistance and immunity to being
charmed or rendered unconscious. Although some wood
elves are an exception, most elf vampires do not take on
animal form and, therefore, lack the Beast Form action.
Young and older elf vampires also gain the Fey Majesty
action, but until the vampire is ancient, as is the one in
the stat block, they can affect only humanoids and beasts
with this power.

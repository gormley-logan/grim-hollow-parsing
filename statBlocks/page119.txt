checks that rely on smell.
Regeneration.
The fate cat regains 5 hit points at the
start of its turn. If the fate cat takes radiant damage, this
trait doesn’t function at the start of the fate cat’s next
turn. The fate cat’s body is destroyed only if it starts its
turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.
Rejuvenation.
When the fate cat’s body is destroyed,
its soul lingers. After 24 hours, the soul inhabits and
animates another cat corpse on the same plane of
existence and regains all its hit points. While the soul
is bodiless, a
wish
spell can be used to force the soul to
go to the afterlife and not return.
Sin Tracker.
The fate cat knows the distance to
and direction of any creature that wronged it, even if
the creature and the fate cat are on different planes of
existence. If the creature it’s tracking dies, then the fate
cat dies as well.
Turn Immunity.
The fate cat is immune to effects that
turn undead.

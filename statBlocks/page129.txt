Water Snare.
Melee Spell Attack: +4 to hit, reach
15 ft., one target.
Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage. If
the target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled
(escape DC 12) and pulled 10 feet closer to the gasper.
Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, its lungs
and mouth fill with water, and the gasper can’t use its
Water Snare on another target. A creature completely
submerged while grappled in this way also takes 7 (2d6)
acid damage at the start of each of the gasper’s turns.

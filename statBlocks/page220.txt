A creature that touches the mjork burner
or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it
takes 7 (2d6) fire damage.
Fire Path.
The mjork burner leaves fire behind in any
space it moves through. Until the start of the mjork’s
next turn, any creature that enters this area for the
first time on a turn or ends its turn there takes 5 (2d4)
fire damage. The fire can ignite flammable objects (not
creatures), causing the mjork’s Fire Path to last longer.
Ignite.
A creature or flammable object ignites if it takes
fire damage from the mjork burner’s attacks. Until a
creature takes an action to douse this fire, the target takes
5 (2d4) fire damage at the start of each of its turns.

The mjork burner sheds bright light in a
10-foot radius and dim light for another 10 feet.

A mjork burner in contact with smoke has
blindsight in that smoke’s area in a radius of up to 120 feet.

Blinding Soot.
A creature that takes fire damage from
a mjork asher’s attacks must make a DC 14 Constitution
saving throw or be blinded until the end of the mjork’s
next turn.
Fiery Body.
A creature that touches the mjork asher or
hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 7
(2d6) fire damage.
Smoke Sense.
A mjork asher in contact with smoke has
blindsight in that smoke’s area in a radius of up to 120 feet.
Smoke Shroud.
While the mjork asher has 41 or more
hit points, smoke renders a sphere within 20 feet of it
heavily obscured. This smoke goes around corners. Even
while the mjork has 40 or fewer hit points, tendrils of this
smoke extend to 60 feet from the mjork, providing smoke
for the Smoke Sense of all mjorks. However, the whole
shroud dissipates during any round the mjork is exposed
to moderate (at least 10 miles per hour) or stronger wind.
Water Susceptibility.
For every 5 feet the mjork asher
moves in water, or for every gallon of water splashed on
it, it takes 1 cold damage.
actions
Multiattack.
The mjork asher makes two attacks.
Slam.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6)
fire damage and Blinding Soot.
Hurl Soot.
Ranged Spell Attack
: +5 to hit, ranged 30/60 ft., one target.
Hit
: 12 (3d6 + 2) fire damage and Blinding Soot. Create Sootlings (1/Day).
The mjork asher chooses
a point within 60 feet of it that it can sense. Smoke fills a
20-foot radius sphere centered on that point. The sphere
spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured.
This smoke lasts until the start of the mjork’s next turn
or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least
10 miles per hour) disperses it. Unless dispersed before
the start of the mjork’s next turn, a sootling swarm forms
in a space in the area, favoring a space a creature hostile
to the mjork occupies. The swarm takes its turn just
after the mjork and obeys the mjork’s verbal commands
(no action for the mjork). If issued no commands, the
swarm acts independently, often attacking a creature
that isn’t its ally. The swarm can survive indefinitely
after being created.

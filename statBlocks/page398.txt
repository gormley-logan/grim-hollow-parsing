halfling vampire customization
A halfling vampire is Small and has less practical Strength
than Medium vampires, along with smaller claws and
teeth. But a halfling vampire shows amazing alacrity
(higher Dexterity), moving with amazing grace past other
creatures and disappearing with little coverâ€”see Cunning
Action and Nimble Stealth. When converting the Hit Dice
to d6s for a Small creature, keep the hit point maximum
as close to the same as possible. Halfling vampires have a
childlike aspect that supernaturally influences other crea-
tures to refrain from harming the vampire in the Innocent
Eyes reaction. Vampirism also accentuates halfling brav-
ery, making the vampire fearless. But halfling vampires
lack Beast Form.

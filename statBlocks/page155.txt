Hive Connection.
The hivewolf matriarch is connected
to other hivewolves within 300 feet via a hivemind, which
they use to share information. This connection means that
if the hivewolf matriarch is aware of a threat, all hivewolves
within 300 feet are also aware of the threat. This effect can
penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches of any
metal other than lead, a thin sheet of lead, or barrier of
force blocks it.
Pack Tactics.
The hivewolf matriarch has advantage
on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the
matriarch’s allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the
ally isn’t incapacitated.

Acid Spray (Recharge 5–6).
The hivewolf matriarch
sprays acid in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area
must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14
(4d6) acid damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.

Amorphous.
The slimm can move through a space as
narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.
Corrosive Body.
A creature that touches the slimm or
hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 5
(2d4) acid damage.
Humanoid Shape.
While the slimm remains still,
it can pass for humanoid to anyone who fails a DC 14
Perception check. If the slimm is in bright light, those
looking at it have advantage on this check.
Nimble Ooze.
The slimm can move through the space
of any creature larger than the slimm. If the slimm moves
through a creature’s space, that creature must succeed
on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw to avoid touching the
slimm’s Corrosive Body.
actions
Pseudopod.
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft.,
one target.
Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage and 7
(3d4) acid damage.
reactions
Explosive Split.
If a Medium slimm takes lightning
damage, slashing damage, thunder damage, or 10 or
more damage during any one turn, and has at least 10 hit
points remaining, it violently splits. Each creature within
20 feet of the slimm must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 7 (3d4) acid damage on a failed save, or
half as much damage on a successful one. Two Small
slimms appear in unoccupied spaces on the ground on
opposite sides of the area, 40 feet apart. Each new slimm
has hit points equal to half the original slimm’s.
Rejoin.
If a Small slimm ends its turn within 5 feet of
another Small slimm, both use a reaction to rejoin into a
Medium slimm in one of the two spaces. They add their
hit points together to determine the hit points of the new
Medium slimm.

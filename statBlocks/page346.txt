Goldmane Boar
Staple of Etharis
. Boars are a central part of everyday
life in Etharis. Domesticated or hunted in the wild, they
are a centerpiece in feasts. A wise adventurer keeps an
eye out for particularly aggressive boars, acknowledging
their danger and the potential of a filling meal.
Rare Beast.
Occasionally, a hunter glimpses a
goldmane boar. These animals avoid humanoid contact.
Cleverer than a regular boar, a goldmane boar can be
detected easier at night when its mane glows softly in the
dark. Killing a goldmane boar is considered bad luck.

Frostbite Fox
Rare Hunter.
Wild frostbite foxes live in packs in
Grarjord. They change with the seasons, fur turning
white in the winter and brown in the spring. What
doesn’t change is the fox’s weird ability to deliver a jolt
of cold with its bite.
Clan Culture.
These foxes are an important part of the
Valikan clan culture. Their furs help the people of the
North survive harsh winters, and the clans are careful
not to overhunt the species.

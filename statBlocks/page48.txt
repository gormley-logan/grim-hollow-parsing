Antler Casting (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).
The cadeer can innately cast any spell stored in its
antlers, requiring no components. Its spellcasting ability is
Intelligence (spell save DC 13, +5 to hit with spell attacks).
If the spell is a cantrip, the cadeer casts it at 5th level.
Magic Sense.
The cadeer can cast
detect magic
and
identify
at will, requiring no components. Given 1 minute
to concentrate, the cadeer can sense magic within 3 miles
outdoors and 300 feet underground. Using this greater
sense, the cadeer senses only significant sources of magic,
including powerful magical beings, the influence of other
planes, strong ongoing spells, and so on. The cadeer has
advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom
(Perception) checks to discern magic.
actions

Melee Weapon Attack
: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit
: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the cadeer has a spell that deals damage stored in its antlers, this
attack deals an extra 2 (1d4) damage of one type that
spell deals.
reactions
Spell Absorption.
If the cadeer is the target of a spell
or included in the area of a spell, provided the spell is
2nd level or lower, the cadeer can absorb the spell with
its antlers. If the cadeer does so, the spell has no effect,
and the cadeer then stores that spell in its antlers. When
the cadeer absorbs a spell, any spell previously stored in
the antlers dissipates harmlessly.

a blightscale dragon’s lair
Blightscale dragons create temporary lairs in which they
suffer the curse in rage and despair. Whether a cave or a
building, the dragon pulls easy entrances down so that
none can view it in its agonized state. The air inside is
rank, and those who draw a full breath become nauseated.
The curse attracts insects that construct colonies resembling
yellow, congealed lumps.
lair actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), an adult or
ancient blightscale dragon takes a lair action to cause one
of the following effects. The dragon can’t use the same
effect two rounds in a row.
•
Insects burst from a hive built on a surface that the
dragon can see within 120 feet of it. Any creature
within 20 feet of the hive must succeed on a DC 15
Constitution saving throw, taking 10 (3d6) piercing
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
on a successful one. A creature that ends its turn in
the cloud takes 10 (3d6) piercing damage. The insects
disperse on initiative count 20 of the next round. They
disperse early if subjected to intense wind or a damaging
area effect.
•
Puslike fluid erupts in a 20-foot radius centered on a
point on the ground the dragon can see within 120 feet
of it. That area becomes difficult terrain, and a creature
moving through this terrain must succeed on a DC 15
Strength saving throw or be grappled (escape DC 15) by
the sucking glop and restrained while grappled in this
way. Another creature can pull a restrained target free
by taking an action and succeeding on a DC 15 Strength
(Athletics) check. The ground dries sufficiently to return
to normal on initiative count 20 of the next round.
•
Foul gas belches forth in a 20-foot-radius sphere from
a point the dragon can see within 120 feet of it. The
cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily

Accursed Death.
When the dragon dies, it exudes a
cloud of sickening, accursed gas. Each creature within
30 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 22 Constitution
saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. A creature
can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns,
ending the effect on itself on a success. However, a creature
that fails two of these saving throws becomes cursed.
A creature cursed in this way takes 22 (4d10) necrotic
damage and can’t regain hit points, and the creature’s hit
point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the
necrotic damage taken. Every 24 hours, the cursed creature
takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage with similar reduction
to the creature’s hit point maximum. If the curse reduces
the target’s hit point maximum to 0, the target dies.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day).
If the dragon fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

The dragon exhales
a 90-foot cone of poisonous insects and vile gas. Each

damage on a successful one.

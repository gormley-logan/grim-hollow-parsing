Accursed Death.
When the dragon dies, it exudes a
cloud of sickening, accursed gas. Each creature within
20 feet of the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Consti-
tution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute.
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a suc-
cess. However, a creature that fails two of these saving
throws becomes cursed. A creature cursed in this way
takes 16 (3d10) necrotic damage and can’t regain hit
points, and the creature’s hit point maximum is re-
duced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage tak-
en. Every 24 hours, the cursed creature takes 16 (3d10)
necrotic damage with similar reduction to the creature’s
hit point maximum. If the curse reduces the target’s hit
point maximum to 0, the target dies.
Legendary Resistance (3/Day).
If the dragon fails a
saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
actions
Multiattack.
The dragon can use its sickening pres-
ence. It then makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit
: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic damage.
Claw.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit
: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage and 3 (1d6) poison damage.
Tail.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +11 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target.
Hit
: 15 (2d8 + 6) bludgeoning damage. Sickening Presence.
Each creature within 60 feet of
the dragon must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving
throw or become poisoned until the end of the dragon’s
next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is
immune to the dragon’s Sickening Presence for 1 hour.
Swarm Breath (Recharge 5–6).
The dragon exhales
a 60-foot cone of poisonous insects and vile gas. Each
creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution
saving throw, taking 28 (8d6) piercing damage and 35
(10d6) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much
damage on a successful one.
legendary actions
The dragon can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the
options here. Only one legendary action can be used at a
time and only at the end of another creature’s turn. The
dragon regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.
Detect.
The dragon makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.
Tail Attack.
The dragon makes a tail attack.
Wing Attack (Takes 2 Actions).
The dragon beats
its wings. Each creature within 10 feet of the dragon
must succeed on a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw or take
13 (2d6 + 6) bludgeoning damage and fall prone. The
dragon can then fly up to half its flying speed.
obscured. Each creature within the cloud at the start
of its turn must make a DC 15 Constitution saving
throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature
is poisoned. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or
are immune to poison automatically succeed on this
saving throw. This cloud disperses on initiative count
20 of the next round. It disperses early if subjected to
intense wind.
regional effects
An adult or ancient blightscale dragon’s curse warps the
land around the dragon’s lair, creating one or more of
the following effects.
•
The smell of decay can be detected 6 miles from the lair,
growing stronger as one moves nearer.
•
Water sources within 1 mile of the lair have soured,
and the water smells and tastes foul. Only the dragon
can drink it safely. Any other creature that does so
must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw
10 minutes later or become poisoned. A poisoned
creature can repeat the saving throw every hour,
ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature
that succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check
or a DC 15 Wisdom check using proficiency with an
herbalism kit can cure this condition with 10 minutes
of effort.
•
Vegetation within 1 mile of the lair is sickly and nasty.
It provides no more than half its normal food value.
Within 1,500 feet of the lair, plants are inedible, and no
wildlife can be found.
•
Beasts and plant creatures within 1 mile of the lair are
aggressive and hard to reason with. In combat, at the
start of its turn, such a creature gains advantage on all
melee weapon attack rolls it makes during that turn,
but attack rolls against it have advantage until the start
of its next turn. Effects that cure disease can end this
effect for 1 day, but it returns if the creature remains in
the area.
If the dragon dies, these effects fade over 2d4 days. Signs
of environmental damage remain indefinitely.

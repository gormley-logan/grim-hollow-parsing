Ever Observant
. These celestials have reduced them-
selves to individual floating eyes that never stop watch-
ing. As such, they cannot be surprised and have advan-
tage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

Flash of Light
. The eye glows with radiant light, filling
a 60-foot radius around it with bright light. All creatures
that can see the eye must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution
saving throw or take 5 (1d4 + 3) radiant damage and be
blinded for one minute. A blinded creature can repeat the
saving throw at the end of each of their turns.
Once the flash has ended, the eye turns invisible and can
teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

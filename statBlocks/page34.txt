Proficiency Bonus +2
Blood Exchange.
As a bonus action, the blood bulb
can give hit points to one blood brooder or another blood
bulb within 5 feet of it, losing hit points so the other
creature gains them. The bulb can’t use this trait if it has
fewer than half its hit points.
actions
Attach.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
Hit: 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target
is Medium or smaller, the blood bulb enters its space and
attaches to it. Also, if the blood bulb has advantage on the
attack roll, it attaches by engulfing the target’s head. Such
a target is blinded and unable to breathe while the blood
bulb is attached in this way.
While attached to the target, the blood bulb can attack
only the target but has advantage on its attack rolls to do
so. On a hit, the target loses an extra 2 (1d4) hit points to
blood loss. The blood bulb moves with the target, and if
it moves on its own, it detaches. Doing so costs the blood
bulb 5 feet of movement.
A creature can use an action to detach a blood bulb. Doing
so requires a successful DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check.

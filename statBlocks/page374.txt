When a creature within 10 feet of the
yggdrasili crown takes psychic damage, it takes an extra
5 (2d4) psychic damage.
Assimilation.
A creature that drops to 0 hit points or
fails a death saving throw within 60 feet of an yggdrasili
crown must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw
or become an yggdrasili drone. A creature near enough
to multiple yggdrasilis needs to make only one saving
throw at the highest DC among those yggdrasilis. This
effect can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches
of any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead or
barrier of force blocks it.
Psychic Static.
Attempts to read an yggdrasili crown’s
thoughts fail. The creature making the attempt must succeed
on a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw or take 14 (2d8 + 5)
psychic damage.
actions
Multiattack.
The yggdrasili crown makes two slam
attacks. It can use psychic whip instead of making a
slam attack.
Slam.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 7 (2d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage, 2 (1d4)
psychic damage, and Aetheric Aura.
Psychic Whip.
A creature the yggdrasili crown can
sense within 120 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15
Intelligence saving throw or take 14 (2d8 + 5) psychic
damage and be unable to take reactions until the start
of its next turn.
Mind Bomb (Recharges after a Short or Long
Rest).
The yggdrasili crown chooses a point it can
sense within 120 feet of it. Psychic noise explodes in a
20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point. Creatures
in that area must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving
throw, taking 22 (4d10) psychic damage on a failed save,
or half as much damage on a successful one. A creature
that fails also can’t take reactions for 1 minute and rolls a
d4 with every ability check or saving throw, subtracting
the number rolled from the check or saving throw result.
A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each
of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
creature.
Hit
: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw,
taking 7 (2d6) fire and 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed
save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If
damage from this fiery poison reduces the target to 0 hit
points and the target dies, the body reduces to hot, ashy
sludge that powders to ash when it cools.
Web (Recharge 5–6).
Ranged Weapon Attack: +5 to hit,
range 30/60 ft., one creature.
Hit: The target is grappled
by webbing (escape DC 12) and restrained while grappled
in this way. The web creates magical darkness and
difficult terrain in a 5-foot space for 1 minute, even if it
misses the target. This darkness dispels magical light
created by a spell of 2nd or lower level. The webbing has
AC 10; hp 10; vulnerability to cold damage; immunity to
bludgeoning, fire, poison, and psychic damage.

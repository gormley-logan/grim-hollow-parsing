If the hag deals a creature psychic damage,
the creature must succeed on a DC 13 Charisma saving
throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount
equal to the psychic damage taken. The hag regains
hit points equal to that amount, gaining any excess as
temporary hit points that last 24 hours. This reduction to
a creature’s hit point maximum lasts until the target finishes
a long rest. The hag can’t reduce a creature’s hit point
maximum to 0, but if a creature with a hit point maximum
of 1 due to this trait drops to 0 hit points, it becomes stable.
When the humanoid recovers from this condition, they
are permanently cursed to be unable to speak. A
remove
curse
or similar magic restores a creature’s voice.

No effect can change the hag’s
form, and an illusion can disguise her only if the illusion
makes her invisible.

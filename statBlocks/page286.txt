Regeneration
. The horror regains 15 hit points at the
start of its turn. If the horror takes fire or radiant damage,
this trait doesn’t function at the start of the horror’s next
turn. The horror’s body is destroyed only if it starts its
turn with 0 hit points and doesn’t regenerate.
Turn Resistance
. The horror has advantage on saving
throws against any effect that turns undead.
Unerring Direction
. The horror knows the distance to
and direction of the creature whose return to life spawned
it, even if the creature and the horror are on different planes
of existence. If the creature being tracked by the horror dies,
the horror dies.

Melee Weapon Attack
: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit
: 27 (3d12 + 8) bludgeoning damage. Bone Storm
. The horror can release a 40-foot cone of
bone fragments and grave dirt, doing 21 (6d6) piercing
damage and 21 (6d6) necrotic damage and giving all
creatures in the cone the bleeding condition (see
Grim
Hollow Campaign Guide
pg. 28) until they take a long rest.
A successful DC 18 Dexterity saving halves the damage
and negates the bleeding condition.

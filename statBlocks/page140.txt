Multiattack.
The piper makes two melee attacks.
Dagger.
Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack
: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
Hit
: 5 (1d4+3) piercing damage. Cruel Notes.
The piper targets a creature within 30 feet
that is charmed by its luring melody. The target must
succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the
target takes 13 (3d8) psychic damage and has disadvantage
on saving throws for 1 minuite. Success results in half as
much damage and no disadvantage on saving throws.
Luring Melody.
The piper plays a magical melody on
its flute. Every living creature within 120 feet of the piper
who hears the melody must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom
saving throw or be charmed until the melody ends. The
piper must take a bonus action on its subsequent turns
to continue playing. It can stop playing at any time. The
song ends if the piper is incapacitated.
While charmed by the piper, a target is incapacitated.
If the charmed target is more than 5 feet away from the
piper, the target must move on its turn toward the piper
by the most direct route, trying to get within 5 feet. It
doesn’t avoid opportunity attacks, but before moving into
damaging terrain, such as lava or a pit, and whenever
it takes damage from a source other than the piper, the
target can repeat the saving throw. A charmed target can
also repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns.
If the saving throw is successful, the effect ends on it.
A target that successfully saves is immune to this
piper’s music for the next 24 hours.

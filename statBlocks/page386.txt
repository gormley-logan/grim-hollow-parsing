downcast vampirecustomization
A downcast vampire often has higher Wisdom than other
vampires, although the change into vampiric form costs
the vampire their celestial magic. Downcast vampires
lack the Beast Form and Mist Form actions, although the
creature still turns to mist if close to destruction. They also
have the Turn Resistance trait. Young and older downcast
vampires have the Dirge action.

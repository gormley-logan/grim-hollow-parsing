moves a grappled target.

The whelmer can enter a hostile
creature’s space and stop there. It can move through a

Melee Weapon Attack
: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the
target is a Large or smaller creature, it is grappled
(escape DC 13). Until this grapple ends, the target can’t
breathe and the whelmer can’t slam another target.
Illusory Distress (Recharges after a Short
or Long Rest).
The whelmer creates an illusion of a
drowning humanoid in a space it can see within 120
feet of it. The illusion seems completely real, including
sounds, smells, and temperature. The whelmer can use
its action to move the illusion to another spot in range
and change its sensory aspects. The elemental can change
minor aspects, such as sounds, without using an action.
Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an
illusion, as creatures and objects can pass through it. A
creature that uses its action to examine the image can
determine that it’s an illusion with a successful DC 12
Intelligence (Investigation) check. If a creature discerns
the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through
the image.

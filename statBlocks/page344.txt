Corpsejaw
Cousins to mountain lions, corpsejaws are battlefield
scavengers. Their powerful jaws allow them to tear
through most armor, so they can eat carrion other
scavengers leave behind. Military organizations such as
the Free Swords issue bounties on corpsejaws to prevent
damage to valuable salvage.

Eye Crawler
An eye crawler is an ambulatory eye that observes
everything. It might be spying for something else. An
eye crawler has no effective attacks. Mages theorize
eye crawlers derive sustenance from light or ambient
magical energy.

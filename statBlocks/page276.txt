Aggressive.
As a bonus action, the red quoxxarie can
move up to its speed toward a hostile creature that it
can see.
Aura of Wrath.
Provided the red quoxxarie isn’t
incapacitated, any creature (including another red
quoxxarie) that starts its turn within 30 feet of one or
more red quoxxaries can grant itself advantage on
attack rolls until the start of its next turn. Attack rolls
against the creature also have advantage until then. If the
creature is hostile to the quoxxarie and uses this aura, the
creature also has disadvantage on Intelligence, Wisdom,
and Charisma checks until the start of its next turn.
Charge.
If the red quoxxarie moves at least 20 feet
straight toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack
on the same turn, the target takes an extra 11 (2d10)
bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must
succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.
Magic Resistance.
The red quoxxarie has advantage on
saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Slippery.
The red quoxxarie has advantage on ability
checks and saving throws made to escape a grapple.

reactions
Get the Horns.
If the red quoxxarie takes 25 or more
damage from one creature out of the quoxxarie’s reach,
the quoxxarie can take the Disengage action and move
up to half its speed toward that creature. If the creature
is then within reach, the quoxxarie can make a ram
attack against it with advantage on the attack roll.

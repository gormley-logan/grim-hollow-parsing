Fiery Grasp
.
Melee Spell Attack
: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 16 (3d8 + 3) fire damage, and the Knifetooth fire-
brand can make the flames leap from the target to another
target up to 20 feet away, dealing that target 3 fire damage.
Fire Bolt.
Ranged Spell Attack
: +5 to hit, range 120 ft., one target.
Hit
: 19 (3d10 + 3) fire damage. Firebrand Aura (Recharges after a Short or
Long Rest)
. The Knifetooth firebrand surrounds itself
with an aura of violet flame, shedding bright light in a
10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
These flames increase the firebrand’s AC by 1. Whenever
a creature within 10 feet of the firebrand hits it with an
attack, the flames leap to the attacker, dealing that attacker
5 (2d4) fire damage. Violet flame outlines a creature struck
by this fire, so the creature gains no benefit from being
invisible until it leaves the aura. This aura lasts for 10
minutes, until the firebrand uses this action again, until
the firebrand is incapacitated or dies, or until the firebrand
uses a bonus action to end it.
reactions
Terrifying Flames.
When the Knifetooth firebrand
deals a creature fire damage, the firebrand can force that
creature to make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw. On a
failure, the creature becomes frightened of the firebrand
until the end of the creature’s or the firebrand’s next
turn, whichever comes later.

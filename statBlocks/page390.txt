dreamer vampire customization
A dreamer vampire needs to eat the psychic energy from
others, and does so in small ways via dreams. Dreamer
vampires are resistant to psychic damage instead of
necrotic. They are a little less agile and more analytical
than vampires of a similar age. All dreamer vampires
have the Nightmare Walker trait. A young or older
dreamer vampire trades in illusion instead of reality and
canâ€™t change their shape. Instead, they have the Dreamer
Escape reaction. Young and older dreamer vampires
have the Nightmare Killer action, too.
A dreamer vampire might be more ponderous than
other vampires of their age (lower Dexterity and AC).
But the vampire makes up for that loss with resilience
(higher Constitution and hit points).
Horrid tales speak of ancient dreamer vampires who
can use Nightmare Killer on multiple targets. To make this
legend true, once per day, the ancient dreamer vampire
can use Nightmare Killer on creatures of its choice within
a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point the vampire
chooses within range of the effect.

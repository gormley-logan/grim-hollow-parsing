Hazy Stealth.
In conditions of heat shimmers or dusty
or misty air, a pesta has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth)
checks, and it can use a bonus action to take the Hide action.
Incorporeal Movement.
The pesta can move through
other creatures and objects as if they were difficult
terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn
inside an object.
Plague Stench.
Any creature not immune to poison
that starts its turn within 5 feet of the pesta must succeed
on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or take 5 (2d4)
poison damage and become poisoned until the start of its
next turn.
actions
Touch.
Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 9 (2d8) necrotic damage plus 9 (2d8) poison damage.
Plague Cloud (Recharge after a Short or Long
Rest).
The pesta creates a 20-foot-radius cloud of
yellowish mist centered on a point it chooses within
60 feet of it. This mist spreads around corners and lightly
obscures its area. The cloud lingers for 1 minute, until
the pesta’s concentration ends (as if concentrating on a
spell), or until strong wind disperses the cloud.
When a creature enters the area for the first time on
a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make
a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. The creature takes
22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as
much damage on a successful one. Someone who fails
the saving throw is also poisoned and subjected to
the pesta’s disease (often sewer plague). Creatures are
affected even if they hold their breath or don’t need to
breathe. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition
on itself on a success. The disease remains until cured.

Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.
Hit: 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage plus 3 (1d6)
acid damage.
Spit.
Ranged Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, range 10/30 ft.,
one creature.
Hit: 7 (2d6) acid damage and the target
must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a
failure, the target becomes vulnerable to bludgeoning
damage. The target can repeat the saving throw at the
end of each of its turns, taking 3 (1d6) acid damage and
continuing the bludgeoning vulnerability on a failure or
ending the effect on itself on a success.
A creature that uses an action to pour water on the
spit grants the target advantage on the saving throw.

Amphibious.
The coral grazer can breathe air and water.
Siege Monster.
The coral grazer deals double damage
to objects and structures.
Unnatural Presence.
A creature that starts its turn
within 30 ft. of the coral grazer feels an unnatural vibration.
If the creature can otherwise sense the coral grazer, it must
succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or become
frightened until the end of the coral grazer’s next turn. A
creature that fails the saving throw by 5 or more is also
paralyzed while frightened in this way. A target that
succeeds on the saving throw is immune to the Unnatural
Presence of all coral grazers for the next 24 hours.

and uses horrid gaze.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 15 ft., one
target.
Hit: 19 (3d8 + 6) slashing damage.
Horrid Gaze.
The coral grazer fixes its eye on one
creature it can see within 120 feet of it. That creature is
affected by the coral grazer’s Unnatural Presence.
An adult coral grazer can attract several larvae to its
feeding area. That means adults are more dangerous
when larvae are about in surrounding waters. Sages
have noted that larvae are more likely to show up when
an adult is in danger.

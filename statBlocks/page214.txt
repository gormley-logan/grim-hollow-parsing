lair actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the memori
lich can take a lair action to cause one of the following
magical effects. The memori lich can’t use the same effect
two rounds in a row.
•
The ground within 120 feet of the memori lich shakes
violently for a moment. Each creature of the memori
lich’s choice in that area must succeed on a DC 16
Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
•
Creatures of the memori lich’s choice within 60 feet of
the lich can’t regain hit points until initiative count 20
on the next round.
•
Shades of those the memori lich has slain swirl around
in a 30-foot sphere centered on the lich. This effect goes
around corners. The shades help the lich, and so the
lich rolls 1d4 with the d20 rolled for any ability check
or saving throw, adding the number rolled on the d4
to the result. The apparitions hinder those hostile to
the lich and outline them with a faint glow. The area
is difficult terrain for such creatures, and they can’t
benefit from being invisible while in the area. These
benefits last until initiative count 20 on the next round.

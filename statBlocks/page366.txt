False Appearance
. While motionless, the wood
weird trapper is indistinguishable from a clump of
beautiful wildflowers.
actions
Restful Spores.
The wood weird trapper releases a puff
of sweet-scented spores at a creature it can sense within
10 ft. of it. Other wood weirds are immune to these spores.
The target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or become poisoned and incapacitated while
poisoned in this way. A poisoned creature falls prone.
The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of
each of its turns, ending the poisoned condition on itself
on a success.
reactions
Cocoon
. When a Medium or smaller humanoid falls
prone within 10 feet of it, the wood weird trapper’s
runners cocoon the creature. The target is grappled
(escape DC 11) and restrained while grappled in
this way. A wood weird trapper can cocoon only one
creature at a time.
At the start of each of the wood weird trapper’s turns,
a creature grappled by the trapper must succeed on a
DC 11 Constitution saving throw or take 3 (1d6) piercing
damage and 3 (1d6) poison damage. If a humanoid dies
while cocooned in this way, its flesh lignifies over 24
hours, and it then rises as a wood weird seeder.

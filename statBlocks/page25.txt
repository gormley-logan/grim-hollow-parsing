Charge.
If the blazehorn moves at least 20 feet straight
toward a target and then hits it with a ram attack on the
same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) bludgeoning
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a
DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.
actions
Ram.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one
target.
Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage.
Firebomb (Recharge 5–6).
The blazehorn launches a
ball of flaming tar at a point it can see within 60 feet of it.
Each creature within 5 feet of that point must make a DC
12 Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, the target takes
7 (3d4) fire damage and ignites. If the save is successful,
the target takes half as much fire damage and doesn’t
catch fire. An ignited creature takes 2 (1d4) fire damage
at the start of each of its turns. A creature can use its
action to repeat the save, extinguishing the flames on a
success. Flammable objects in the area also catch fire.
reactions
Defensive Launch.
When the blazehorn drops to
fewer than half its hit points, it recharges Firebomb and
uses it immediately. It targets the source of the damage
that triggered this reaction if possible.

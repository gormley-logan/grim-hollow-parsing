Thorn Rot.
A humanoid that takes damage from a
thornhost’s thorns or burst must succeed on a DC 12
Constitution save or take 2 (1d4) more piercing damage
as the thorn burrows for 3 rounds. Upon failing three
saves, the damage ends, but the thorn takes root, the
humanoid can’t regain the hit points lost to the thorn
while the infection lasts, and the humanoid gains one
level of exhaustion as fever and delirium set in. During
the first 24 hours, the thorn can be removed, but doing so
requires someone who has proficiency in the Medicine
skill to succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check.
If the thorn remains, at the end of each long rest, the
infected creature must succeed on a DC 12 (+1 per thorn,
up to DC 15) Constitution saving throw or gain one level
of exhaustion. If the creature dies from exhaustion, its
soul departs its still-living body and it becomes a new
thornhost with no levels of exhaustion.

Burst.
The thornhost dies, sending thorns flying in a 20-
foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12
Dexterity save, taking 12 (4d4 + 2) piercing damage on a
failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

reactions
Now I’m Angry.
When Gillian takes damage that
reduces her current hit points to half or less than her
maximum hit points, she gains temporary hit points
equal to half her maximum hit points. While she
has these temporary hit points, she has resistance to
bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. She loses
all temporary hit points gained from this ability after
10 minutes. Once she uses this reaction, she can’t use it
again until she finishes a long rest.

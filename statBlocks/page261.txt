Devil’s Sight.
Magical darkness doesn’t impede the
poppet’s darkvision.
Eerie Laugh.
As a bonus action, the poppet laughs,
and each creature within 30 feet of and able to hear the
poppet must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw.
On a failure, the creature becomes frightened of the
poppet for 1 minute. If the saving throw fails by 5 or
more, the target’s speed is halved while it’s frightened
in this way. A frightened target can repeat the saving
throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage
if the poppet is within line of sight, ending the effect on
itself on a success. If a target’s saving throw is successful
or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the Eerie
Laugh of any poppet for the next 24 hours
False Appearance.
While the poppet remains motionless,
it’s indistinguishable from an ordinary doll.
Turning Susceptibility.
The poppet can be turned
as if it were undead. However, it can’t be destroyed by
effects that turn undead.

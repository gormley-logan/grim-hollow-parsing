As a bonus action, the raven of ill
omen can select up to six other creatures it can see within
60 feet of it. The raven assigns each creature a bane or
boon for 1 minute, until the raven dies, or until it uses
this trait again. A creature given a bane must make a
DC 12 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, when the
creature makes an ability check or a saving throw while
the bane lasts, the creature must roll a d4 and subtract
the number rolled from the result. When a target given a
boon makes an ability check or a saving throw while the
boon lasts, the target can roll a d4 and add the number
rolled to the result. These effects don’t stack with similar
ones, such as the

and

Blood Master.
The blood tracker can be bound to one
other evil creature, a master, by eating the master’s blood
for 13 days. While the master is within 100 ft. of the blood
tracker, the two can communicate telepathically. As an
action, provided the blood tracker is within 300 ft. of
the master, the master can use the tracker’s senses until
the start of the master’s next turn. The master can’t use
its own senses during this time.
Blood Tracker.
The blood tracker has advantage
on Wisdom checks to track living creatures. If such a
creature has lost any hit points, magic can’t prevent the
blood tracker from tracking the creature.
Keen Hearing and Smell.
The blood tracker has
advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely
on hearing or smell.
actions
Multiattack
. The blood tracker makes one bite attack
and uses blood bay.
Bite.
Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.
Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic
damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a
DC 15 Strength saving throw or fall prone.
Blood Bay.
The blood tracker chooses one creature it can
sense within 60 feet of it. That creature must make a DC 13
Wisdom saving throw with disadvantage if the creature
is not at full hit points. On a failure, the creature takes 13
(3d8) thunder damage, or 19 (3d12) thunder damage if not
at full hit points, and it becomes frightened until the end
of the blood tracker’s next turn. While frightened in this
way, the creature’s speed drops to 0.

shape of a Large bear. While in this form, it can speak to

time it takes this form each day.

DC 20 Intelligence (Nature)
: While the nature of the transformation tends to override the senses with bestial
fury, some can control themselves. By finding a balance
between man and beast, they gain greater control over
the curse, gaining the ability to turn into a full animal
and retain their mental faculties.

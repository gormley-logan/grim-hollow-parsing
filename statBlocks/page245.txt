Corrupt Desire.
A humanoid may bind themselves to
the ordeal tree. Each day the petitioner is bound to the
tree, they must succeed on a Constitution saving throw
with a DC equal to 15 + number of days bound or suffer a
level of exhaustion. If they survive for 7 days, the ordeal
tree may choose to grant a blessing. The tree only does
this if the humanoid is evil, once per humanoid. If the
humanoid is neutral or good, the tree attacks them.
The blessing is tailored to the petitioner’s desires (GM
discretion) but might include +1 to an ability score, a feat,
expertise in a skill, or the ability to innately cast a 3rd-
level (or lower) spell once per day using Charisma as the
petitioner’s spellcasting ability.
The petitioner also contracts the curse of foul blight
(Grim Hallow Campaign Guide pg. 25). If the petitioner
commits a profoundly evil act every day, the curse
never advances beyond stage 1. If the petitioner fails to
commit the act, the curse automatically escalates.
False Appearance.
While the ordeal tree remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from a normal tree.
Heart Sight.
The ordeal tree knows the alignment
and desires of any creature that binds itself to the tree.

saving throw or suffer 44 (8d10) necrotic damage. The
ordeal tree gains temporary hit points equal to half the
damage done.

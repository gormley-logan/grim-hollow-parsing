Humid Habitat.
Meyanas live in forests or other
tropical, subtropical, or temperate climates. They
camouflage themselves in thick vegetation, making
their hunting easier. Meyanas live in sheltered thickets
or wet underground areas. They prefer enclosed spaces
to open ones.
Despite their preferences, meyanas can survive in any
area that supports plant growth. They can be a threat
to any area in which they can gain a foothold. Only
inadequate prey can slow their proliferation.
Meyanas congregate in small tribes. Those tribes work
together in a larger system that cooperates, shares food,
and defends each other.

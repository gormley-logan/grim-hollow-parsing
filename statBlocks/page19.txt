“One rotten arcanist in a community might seem like a
small threat, but like a similarly rotten apple, within days
the entire bushel basket is corrupted if the rot is not
discovered and eliminated quickly. Unlike an apple, however,
discovering a rotten soul is much more difficult. Fortunately,
our Inquisition have tools at our disposal that allow us to
ferret out that rot. Once it’s discovered through our use of
the will of Empyreus, then more mundane tools are at
our disposal. Assuming, of course, that you consider
a very sharp blade applied to a neck as a mundane tool.”
“Illusions. Enchantments. Necromancy. Conjurations.
There’s no denying the varied and terrible methods that
arcanists might use to wreak their corrupted havoc on
the innocent sheep. The only force standing between
the population and vile arcanists are us. Striking down
the users of magic is one step in our plan, but we also
have to understand how magic affects our charges, and
how to break the magical bonds that they often find
themselves shackled by.”

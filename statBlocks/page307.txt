Load
. The skeleton cannoneer loads the dead cannon.
Dead Cannon
. The skeleton cannoneer fires its loaded
cannon at a point it can see within 500 feet of it, but no
closer than 50 feet from it. Each creature within 15 feet
of that point must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw,
taking 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and 7 (2d6) necrotic
damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a
successful one.
Alternatively, the cannoneer can choose the cannon as
the point of fire. Doing so means the shot goes off inside
the cannon, destroying it and increasing each type of
damage by 3 (1d6).

Pike
.
Melee Weapon Attack
: +5 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.
Hit
: 8 (1d10 + 3) piercing damage and 5 (2d4) necrotic damage.
Warlord Strike (Recharge 5–6).
The skeleton com-
mander makes one pike attack. The commander can use
a bonus action to direct another undead who can see or
hear the commander to attack the target the commander
attacked this turn. That undead can use a reaction to
make the attack, adding the commander’s proficiency
bonus to the damage roll.
reactions
Brandish Standard
. If an undead the skeleton
commander can see within 30 feet of the commander
makes an attack roll or saving throw, the commander
can brandish the tattered banner on its pike. If the
commander does so, the target can add a d4 to its roll,
provided it can see the commander and isn’t receiving
this benefit from another commander.
Effective Commanders
. A sufficiently powerful
necromancer can use the corpse of an officer to raise a
skeleton commander. Infusing the skeleton’s bones with
an approximation of its knowledge and presence in life
takes a great deal of power, but it allows a necromancer
to better direct and inspire an army of the dead.

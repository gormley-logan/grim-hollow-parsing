Devour Soul.
A maskenmagier can consume the soul
of a humanoid it has killed within the last hour requiring
the maskenmagier to be within 5 ft. of the corpse for 10
minutes. The victim’s soul is trapped in the maskenmagier
for 24 hours. If the maskenmagier dies before then or the
soul is subjected to magic that raises the dead, the soul is
freed. Otherwise, after 24 hours, the soul is digested, and
no mortal magic can restore it. The maskenmagier can
digest only one soul at a time.
After it has digested a soul, the maskenmagier gains
a soul mask in the likeness of the owner of the devoured
soul. The maskenmagier can use this mask along with
the Shapechanger trait for 13 days.
Magic Resistance.
The maskenmagier has advantage
on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.
Teleport (Recharge 4–6).
As its movement, the
maskenmagier can teleport to an unoccupied space
within 30 feet of it that it can see.
Quick Cantrip.
The maskenmagier can use a bonus
action to cast a cantrip.
Shapechanger.
The maskenmagier can use its action
to polymorph into a Small or Medium humanoid, or
back into its true form. Its statistics, other than its size,
are the same in each form. If the maskenmagier has a
humanoid’s soul mask, the fiend can meld the mask
with a new humanoid form, allowing the maskenmagier
to perfectly pass for that person. The maskenmagier
instinctively says and does the right things, including
speaking the correct language in the correct accent, if the
fiend succeeds at a Charisma (Deception) check, which
the fiend makes with advantage while wearing the soul
mask. Any other equipment it is wearing or carrying
isn’t transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.
